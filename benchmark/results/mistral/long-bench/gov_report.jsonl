{"id": 0, "pred": "The report outlines the process by which postsecondary schools become certified to participate in federal student aid programs. To be eligible, schools must be certified by the Education department, accredited by a recognized accrediting agency, and authorized by the state. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) office is responsible for ensuring schools meet these requirements and administer federal student aid funds properly. FSA conducts ongoing financial oversight, including reviewing annual financial statement audits and conducting program reviews. Compliance audits, which are required annually, provide valuable information for assessing a school's administrative capability. However, the quality of these audits varies, and FSA and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) have taken steps to improve audit quality, such as providing additional training for auditors and clarifying procedures in the audit guide. FSA uses compliance audits and program reviews to determine recertification decisions, and schools in provisional certification status are subject to additional monitoring. From 2006 to 2017, most schools were approved for certification, with denial rates being lowest for public schools and highest for for-profit schools. FSA and OIG efforts to address audit quality aim to ensure accurate and reliable information for Education's recertification decisions.", "answers": ["Education provided over $122 billion in grants, loans and work study funds to help students pay for college at about 6,000 schools in fiscal year 2017. Education is responsible for certifying that these schools are eligible for and capable of properly administering federal student aid funds. Schools are required to submit an annual compliance audit that provides information on schools' administrative capability, which Education considers in its school certification decisions. GAO was asked to review Education's process for certifying schools to receive federal student aid. This report examines (1) how Education certifies schools to administer federal student aid and how frequently schools are approved and denied certification; and (2) the role of compliance audits in the certification process and what, if any, steps Education has taken to address the quality of the audit information. GAO analyzed data on school certification outcomes for calendar years 2006-2017 (when GAO determined data were most reliable); reviewed data and reports summarizing Education's reviews of compliance audit quality for fiscal years 2006-2017; reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 21 school certification decisions from fiscal years 2015 and 2016, selected for a mix of decisions, school characteristics, and geographic regions; examined relevant federal laws, regulations, policy manuals and guidance; and interviewed Education officials. The Department of Education (Education) is responsible for evaluating a variety of information to determine whether a postsecondary school should be certified to administer federal student aid programs, and agency data show that it approves most schools that apply. Education procedures instruct regional office staff to review school policies, financial statements, and compliance audits prepared by independent auditors, among other things. Education can certify schools to participate in federal student aid programs for up to 6 years, or it can provisionally certify them for less time if it determines that increased oversight is needed—for example, when a school applies for certification for the first time or when it has met some but not all requirements to be fully certified. In calendar years 2006 through 2017, Education fully or provisionally approved most schools applying for initial or recertification to receive federal student aid (see figure). Note: Schools applying for certification for the first time and approved are placed in provisional certification. In deciding whether to certify schools, Education particularly relies on compliance audits for direct information about how well schools are administering federal student aid, and Education's offices of Federal Student Aid and Inspector General have taken steps to address audit quality. The Inspector General annually selects a sample of compliance audits for quality reviews based on risk factors, such as auditors previously cited for errors. In fiscal years 2006 through 2017, 59 percent of the 739 selected audits received failing scores. Audits that fail must be corrected; if not, the school generally must repay federal student aid covered by the audit. Because higher risk audits are selected for review, Inspector General officials said they cannot assess the overall prevalence of quality problems in compliance audits. These two Education offices have taken steps to improve audit quality. For example, the Inspector General offered additional training to auditors on its revised 2016 audit guide and provided guidance to schools on hiring an auditor, while Federal Student Aid created a working group to strengthen its procedures for addressing poor quality compliance audits. Education's efforts to address audit quality could help ensure that these audits provide reliable information for school certification decisions.

According to the Department of State, this assistance to the Palestinians promotes U.S. economic and political foreign policy interests by supporting Middle East peace negotiations and financing economic stabilization programs. USAID is primarily responsible for administering ESF assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included provisions for GAO to review the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This report examines (1) the status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including project assistance and payments to PA creditors, and (2) the extent to which USAID conducted required vetting of PA creditors to ensure that this assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism and assessed PA ministries' capacity to use ESF assistance as intended. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations and USAID financial data, policies, procedures, and documents. GAO also interviewed USAID and State Department officials. As of March 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had allocated about $545 million of funding appropriated to the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. USAID obligated about $544 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $351 million (over 64 percent) of the total allocations. Project assistance accounted for approximately $399 million of the obligated funds, while payments to Palestinian Authority (PA) creditors accounted for $145 million (see figure). USAID's obligations for project assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 supported three development objectives—Economic Growth and Infrastructure ($239 million), Investing in the Next Generation ($107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, USAID made payments directly to PA creditors—two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. USAID vetted PA creditors to ensure that the program assistance would not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism and also conducted external assessments and financial audits of PA ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. USAID documentation showed that, as required, officials checked the vetting status of each PA creditor within 12 months before USAID signed its debt relief grant agreements with the PA. In addition, although USAID determined that it was not legally required to assess the PA Ministry of Health's medical referral services and the Ministry of Finance and Planning's petroleum procurement system, the agency commissioned external assessments of both ministries. These assessments found some weaknesses in both ministries' systems; however, USAID mission officials stated that these weaknesses did not affect USAID debt relief payments to the PA creditors. Nevertheless, USAID took additional steps to mitigate the identified weaknesses. For example, a USAID contractor worked with the Ministry of Health to update, revise, and approve guidelines for medical referrals. In addition, USAID commissioned financial audits of the debt relief grant agreements between USAID and the PA for direct payments to PA creditors in fiscal year 2015 and 2016. The audits did not identify any ineligible costs, reportable material weaknesses in internal control, or material instances of noncompliance with the terms of the agreements.

When a state, U.S. territory, or tribe requests IA assistance through a federal disaster declaration, FEMA evaluates the request against regulatory factors, such as concentration of damages, and provides a recommendation to the President, who makes a final declaration decision. GAO was asked to review FEMA's IA declaration process. This report examines (1) the number of IA declaration requests received, declared, and denied, and IA actual obligations from calendar years 2008 through 2016, (2) the extent to which FEMA accounts for the regulatory factors when evaluating IA requests, and (3) any challenges FEMA regions and select states reported on the declaration process and factors and any FEMA actions to revise them. GAO reviewed FEMA's policies, IA declaration requests and obligation data, and FEMA's RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016, the most recent years for which data were available. GAO also reviewed proposed rulemaking comments and interviewed FEMA officials from all 10 regions and 11 state emergency management offices selected based on declaration requests and other factors. From calendar years 2008 through 2016, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency and Management Agency (FEMA) received 294 Individual Assistance (IA) declaration requests from states, U.S. territories, and tribes to help individuals meet their immediate needs after a disaster. Of these, the President declared 168 and denied 126 requests. Across the various types of IA declaration requests, severe storms (190) were the most common disaster type and drought (1) was among the least common. FEMA obligated about $8.6 billion in IA for disaster declarations during this period. GAO found that FEMA regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of established IA regulatory factors when making IA recommendations to headquarters. Following a declaration request, a FEMA region is to prepare a Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR)—a document designed to include data on each of the six IA regulatory factors for each declaration request as well as the regional administrator's recommendation. GAO reviewed all 81 RVARs from July 2012—the date FEMA began using the new RVAR template—through December 2016. GAO found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information for the elements required under the six regulatory factors (see table). For example, only 44 of the 81 RVARs documented all elements under the concentration of damage factor. By evaluating why regions are not completing all elements of each current IA regulatory factor, FEMA could identify whether any corrective steps are needed. Officials from the 10 FEMA regions and 11 states GAO interviewed, reported positive relationships with each other, but also cited various challenges with the IA declaration process and regulatory factors. For example, these officials told GAO that there are no established minimum thresholds for IA, making final determinations more subjective and the rationale behind denials unclear. However, as required by the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, FEMA has taken steps to revise the IA factors by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. According to FEMA, the proposed rule aims to provide more objective criteria, clarify the threshold for eligibility, and speed up the IA declaration process. As of April 2018, the proposed rule was still under consideration.

{"id": 3, "pred": "The report outlines the role of the Senate in providing advice and consent on presidential nominations, also known as the confirmation process. The process serves multiple purposes, including examining nominees' qualifications and potential conflicts of interest, influencing policy, and increasing the Senate's influence with the executive branch. The Senate considers approximately 67,000 nominations per Congress, with military appointments and promotions making up the majority. Civilian nominations include federal judges, officers in executive departments, independent agencies, and regulatory boards and commissions. The Senate cannot consider all nominations in detail, so a regularized process is used to facilitate quick action on thousands of government positions. The Senate can approve or reject nominations with a majority of Senators present and voting.\n\nThe report also discusses the history of the confirmation process and recent concerns, including the rate of confirmation for high-ranking positions and judgeships, as well as the speed of Senate action on routine nominations. The Senate has made several changes to the confirmation process since 2011, including reducing the maximum time allowed for consideration after cloture is invoked from 30 hours to 2 hours. The report concludes by discussing the impact of these changes on the nominations process and the role of holds in influencing the confirmation of nominees.", "answers": ["Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution provides that the President shall appoint officers of the United States \"by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.\" This report describes the process by which the Senate provides advice and consent on presidential nominations, including receipt and referral of nominations, committee practices, and floor procedure. Committees play the central role in the process through investigations and hearings. Senate Rule XXXI provides that nominations shall be referred to appropriate committees \"unless otherwise ordered.\" Most nominations are referred, although a Senate standing order provides that some \"privileged\" nominations to specified positions will not be referred unless requested by a Senator. The Senate rule concerning committee jurisdictions (Rule XXV) broadly defines issue areas for committees, and the same jurisdictional statements generally apply to nominations as well as legislation. A committee often gathers information about a nominee either before or instead of a formal hearing. A committee considering a nomination has four options. It can report the nomination to the Senate favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation, or it can choose to take no action. It is more common for a committee to take no action on a nomination than to reject a nominee outright. The Senate handles executive business, which includes both nominations and treaties, separately from its legislative business. All nominations reported from committee are listed on the Executive Calendar, a separate document from the Calendar of Business, which lists pending bills and resolutions. Generally speaking, the majority leader schedules floor consideration of nominations on the Calendar. Nominations are considered in \"executive session,\" a parliamentary form of the Senate in session that has its own journal and, to some extent, its own rules of procedure. The Senate can call up a nomination expeditiously, because a motion to enter executive session to consider a specific nomination on the Calendar is not debatable. This motion requires a majority of Senators present and voting, a quorum being present, for approval. After a nomination has been called up, the question before the Senate is \"will the Senate advise and consent to this nomination?\" A majority of Senators voting is required to approve a nomination. However, Senate rules place no limit on how long a nomination may be debated, and ending consideration could require invoking cloture. On April 6, 2017, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII in order to allow cloture to be invoked on nominations to the Supreme Court by a majority of Senators voting. This expanded the results of similar actions taken by the Senate in November 2013, which changed the cloture vote requirement to a majority for nominations other than to the Supreme Court. After the 2013 decision, the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process increased. On April 3, 2019, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII again. The Senate reduced, from 30 hours to 2 hours, the maximum time nominations can be considered after cloture has been invoked. This change applied to all executive branch nominations except to high-level positions such as heads of departments, and it applied to all judicial nominations except to the Supreme Court and the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The full impact of this change is difficult to assess at this time, but it is likely to shorten the time between a cloture vote and a vote on the nomination. If Senators respond as they did to the last reinterpretation of the cloture rule, it might also increase the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process. Nominations that are pending when the Senate adjourns sine die at the end of a session or recesses for more than 30 days are returned to the President unless the Senate, by unanimous consent, waives the rule requiring their return (Senate Rule XXXI, clause 6). If a nomination is returned, and the President still desires Senate consideration, he must submit a new nomination."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5595, "token_length": 7972, "chunk_ppl": [8.777694702148438, 9.889630317687988, 10.008899688720703, 7.796581745147705, 6.566147327423096, 7.309187889099121, 5.649104595184326, 11.140300750732422, 7.825225353240967, 6.921848297119141, 8.573180198669434, 3.9260406494140625, 3.270467519760132, 8.304834365844727, 9.385605812072754, 8.814306259155273, 8.619593620300293, 5.877847671508789, 4.578556537628174, 7.079916954040527, 3.378302574157715, 7.766380310058594, 5.327798843383789, 5.684442043304443, 5.071743488311768, 4.225353717803955, 4.997312545776367, 5.392083644866943, 7.872196197509766, 4.86303186416626, 5.8543477058410645, 10.800914764404297, 5.8988800048828125, 8.648841857910156, 6.603893756866455, 4.903165340423584, 4.242404937744141, 5.911520481109619, 6.174543857574463, 7.288074970245361, 6.326218128204346, 5.653728008270264, 4.279688835144043, 7.635458946228027, 5.505407333374023, 5.927309989929199, 8.031453132629395, 7.014103889465332, 5.214615345001221, 6.017199993133545, 7.114511966705322, 7.555250644683838, 7.596649646759033, 7.026916027069092, 4.632358074188232, 3.8884811401367188, 5.6370744705200195, 5.612026691436768, 31.172143936157227], "total_ppl": 6.38151216506958, "block_sizes": [17, 13, 25, 8, 12, 14, 9, 12, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 9, 17, 11, 15, 10, 16, 13, 26, 10, 10, 12, 12, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 10, 10, 17, 10, 10, 13, 18, 20, 23, 9, 15, 28, 16, 9, 12, 8, 8, 8, 12, 9, 12, 10, 10, 15, 19, 18, 32, 11, 9, 12, 8, 9, 12, 10, 8, 8, 12, 17, 9, 11, 13, 19, 8, 8, 18, 10, 24, 29, 10, 14, 11, 10, 22, 8, 15, 18, 9, 9, 20, 8, 13, 9, 14, 18, 10, 12, 18, 13, 11, 12, 15, 18, 16, 26, 26, 12, 17, 13, 26, 16, 10, 15, 17, 26, 10, 28, 23, 10, 19, 12, 8, 8, 11, 10, 13, 16, 8, 12, 8, 15, 14, 18, 9, 14, 9, 8, 10, 9, 14, 9, 9, 10, 10, 9, 9, 13, 9, 21, 10, 15, 18, 10, 10, 11, 8, 12, 12, 10, 14, 20, 16, 12, 12, 10, 13, 17, 9, 11, 11, 17, 9, 12, 13, 32, 9, 9, 32, 19, 8, 10, 12, 12, 9, 12, 13, 14, 8, 10, 8, 11, 13, 26, 23, 20, 32, 10, 8, 8, 23, 9, 17, 9, 16, 25, 20, 32, 13, 8, 13, 15, 15, 17, 9, 10, 8, 14, 12, 16, 11, 10, 17, 22, 22, 20, 10, 12, 9, 25, 8, 10, 8, 32, 15, 18, 32, 11, 13, 23, 15, 14, 8, 25, 15, 20, 21, 9, 13, 13, 8, 19, 8, 8, 11, 12, 13, 9, 8, 17, 14, 13, 10, 10, 8, 8, 8, 20, 8, 11, 14, 25, 8, 12, 8, 11, 12, 9, 16, 8, 12, 16, 8, 8, 8, 10, 10, 18, 9, 16, 14, 15, 8, 10, 8, 11, 10, 12, 17, 16, 12, 10, 25, 15, 9, 12, 20, 11, 10, 10, 9, 19, 8, 12, 8, 18, 10, 12, 21, 15, 11, 16, 14, 8, 14, 12, 9, 13, 8, 11, 25, 32, 12, 8, 10, 17, 17, 11, 9, 17, 18, 8, 11, 32, 14, 11, 13, 17, 11, 10, 13, 31, 15, 9, 9, 9, 11, 9, 16, 8, 11, 13, 17, 8, 16, 14, 8, 10, 14, 13, 14, 8, 14, 9, 10, 13, 13, 29, 18, 8, 11, 8, 17, 16, 22, 12, 9, 28, 10, 16, 12, 8, 8, 8, 13, 10, 9, 8, 8, 10, 20, 13, 15, 17, 10, 17, 9, 8, 8, 32, 13, 10, 8, 8, 11, 15, 20, 28, 8, 11, 12, 9, 28, 18, 25, 8, 8, 25, 11, 12, 16, 8, 27, 15, 13, 17, 16, 11, 17, 12, 10, 9, 8, 12, 15, 9, 13, 14, 8, 11, 18, 9, 8, 10, 19, 8, 31, 17, 9, 12, 10, 11, 10, 28, 14, 10, 14, 14, 15, 12, 16, 18, 8, 8, 15, 11, 8, 17, 9, 8, 9, 8, 13, 16, 23, 22, 10, 13, 12, 8, 8, 9, 10, 22, 18, 13, 10], "mean_block_size": 13.42020202020202, "generation_time": 458.6020269393921}

The LHWCA program, administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), paid approximately $1.41 billion in cash and medical benefits to injured and deceased workers in 2016. Workers' compensation is mandatory in all states and the District of Columbia, except for Texas, where employers may opt out under certain conditions. The LHWCA covers medical benefits, disability benefits, and survivors benefits for workers and their families.

Firms that employ these workers are required to purchase workers' compensation or self-insure and are responsible for providing medical and disability benefits to covered workers who are injured or become ill on the job and survivors benefits to the families of covered workers who die on the job. The LHWCA is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), and all benefit costs are paid by employers and their insurance carriers. In 2016, more than $1.4 billion in LHWCA benefits were paid to beneficiaries. Congress has extended the LHWCA provisions to cover workers outside of the maritime industry, such as overseas government contractors and civilian employees of military post exchanges. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), persons who repair recreational vessels of any size were added to the LHWCA exemption list.

Requests can be submitted to FEMA Regional Administrators and can be made by telephone for expedited processing. Under the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, tribes have the same ability as states to request FMAGs.\n\nThe report outlines the process for requesting FMAGs, which includes providing cost estimates and information about the fire size, population threatened, and available state and local resources. FEMA uses criteria such as the threat to lives and property, availability of state and local resources, high fire danger conditions, and potential economic impacts to determine if an FMAG should be issued. FEMA has established fire cost thresholds to help determine eligibility for assistance.\n\nFMAGs are funded through FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund and are not contingent on the DRF balance or reduction of major disaster funding. FMAGs provide assistance for suppression operations on nonfederal lands, while suppression operations on federal lands are the responsibility of the federal agency with jurisdiction. Limited exceptions may occur for fires on lands with mixed federal and nonfederal ownership.\n\nThe report also mentions other federal assistance programs related to wildfire management, such as postfire recovery assistance and assistance planning and mitigating potential risk from future wildfires.

{"id": 6, "pred": "The report by the government agency provides an overview of the Navy's attack submarine fleet, which consists of 51 submarines of three classes: Los Angeles, Seawolf, and Virginia. The fleet is homeported in the US and overseas, with a focus on safety and adherence to maintenance and training standards. The report highlights the impact of maintenance delays on the fleet, which has resulted in significant idle time and operating and support costs. The Navy's SUBSAFE program, established after the loss of the USS Thresher in 1963, ensures strict safety requirements and certifications for submarines. Since its implementation, no SUBSAFE-certified submarine has been lost. However, the report notes that the Navy has faced challenges in completing attack submarine maintenance on time due to workforce shortages, poor facility conditions, and parts shortages, among other factors. The Navy has begun addressing these challenges through hiring and capital investments, but sustained management attention is required to fully mitigate the issue. The report recommends that the Chief of Naval Operations conduct a business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards and assess private shipyard capacity to perform attack submarine maintenance. The report also notes that the Navy has faced persistent challenges to rebuilding readiness and addressing maintenance, training, and other issues affecting the fleet.", "answers": ["According to the Navy, its 51 attack submarines provide the United States an asymmetric advantage to gather intelligence undetected, attack enemy targets, and insert special forces, among others. These capabilities make attack submarines some of the most–requested assets by the global combatant commanders. GAO was asked to review the readiness of the Navy's attack submarine force. This report discusses the extent to which the Navy (1) has experienced maintenance delays in its attack submarine fleet and costs associated with any delays; and (2) has addressed any challenges and developed mitigation plans for any maintenance delays. GAO analyzed readiness information from fiscal years 2008-2018, operating and support costs, maintenance performance, and other data; visited attack submarines and squadrons; and interviewed public and private shipyard and fleet officials. This is a public version of a classified report issued in October 2018. Information the Department of Defense deemed classified or sensitive, such as attack submarine force structure requirements and detailed data on attack submarine maintenance delays, has been omitted. The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures. GAO's analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that between fiscal year 2008 and 2018, attack submarines have incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays as a result of delays in getting into and out of the shipyards. For example, the Navy originally scheduled the USS Boise to enter a shipyard for an extended maintenance period in 2013 but, due to heavy shipyard workload, the Navy delayed the start of the maintenance period. In June 2016, the USS Boise could no longer conduct normal operations and the boat has remained idle, pierside for over two years since then waiting to enter a shipyard (see figure). GAO estimated that since fiscal year 2008 the Navy has spent more than $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars to support attack submarines that provide no operational capability—those sitting idle while waiting to enter the shipyards, and those delayed in completing their maintenance at the shipyards. The Navy has started to address challenges related to workforce shortages and facilities needs at the public shipyards. However, it has not effectively allocated maintenance periods among public shipyards and private shipyards that may also be available to help minimize attack submarine idle time. GAO's analysis found that while the public shipyards have operated above capacity for the past several years, attack submarine maintenance delays are getting longer and idle time is increasing. The Navy may have options to mitigate this idle time and maintenance delays by leveraging private shipyard capacity for repair work. But the Navy has not completed a comprehensive business case analysis as recommended by Department of Defense guidelines to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. Navy leadership has acknowledged that they need to be more proactive in leveraging potential private shipyard repair capacity. Without addressing this challenge, the Navy risks continued expenditure of operating and support funding to crew, maintain, and support attack submarines that provide no operational capability because they are delayed in getting into and out of maintenance. GAO recommends that the Navy conduct a business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards.

The report recommends that the Secretaries of State and Agriculture include information about the funding restrictions in their training materials for employees conducting export promotion activities overseas. Additionally, the agencies should assess and update the interagency guidance cable to address ambiguities. The report found that most officials overseas were aware of the restrictions but some had not received training or guidance. The United States exported over $2 billion in tobacco and tobacco products in 2017, with most exports going to Asia and North America. The report also mentions that tobacco exports to Asia have decreased significantly while exports to North America have increased. The report was based on interviews with officials in headquarters and overseas, a literature search, and a review of agency documents.", "answers": ["The World Health Organization estimates that tobacco use kills over 7 million people each year, more than tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria combined. Since the 1990s, Congress has enacted restrictions regarding the use of certain appropriated funds to promote U.S. tobacco exports. GAO was asked to review the implementation of these restrictions. This report examines (1) guidance select U.S. agencies have issued to implement these restrictions, (2) whether overseas officials from select U.S. agencies were aware of the restrictions and guidance, and (3) select U.S. agencies' implementation of the guidance overseas. GAO reviewed U.S. laws, agency guidance, and internal communications; analyzed Commerce data; and interviewed agency officials in Washington, D.C. and in 24 offices across 11 overseas posts in 9 countries. GAO selected these countries based on criteria that included U.S. tobacco export totals, smoking rates, and geographic dispersion. Congress has restricted the use of certain appropriated funding to promote tobacco exports and the Departments of State (State), Commerce (Commerce), and Agriculture (USDA) have issued interagency guidance through the cable system that they rely on to implement these restrictions. State collaborates with these and other agencies to periodically update this cable. The cable informs officials about the types of actions they should take—such as providing routine business facilitation services to all U.S. companies—and the types of actions they should not take—such as attending events sponsored by tobacco companies. Most, but not all, officials overseas that GAO interviewed were aware of the restrictions and received some guidance concerning the restrictions. However, GAO found that some officials did not recall receiving the interagency guidance cable. In addition, State and USDA's current training materials do not address the restrictions. Federal internal control standards state that appropriate training is essential to an organization's operational success. Thus, providing officials overseas with training about the funding restrictions and related guidance would help to ensure that officials are aware of the restrictions. U.S. officials overseas have implemented restrictions on promoting tobacco, but some officials said that the interagency guidance lacks clarity. Officials said that they have not promoted tobacco by, for example, attending events sponsored solely by tobacco companies. However, officials identified three areas of the guidance that are unclear: (1) attendance at events not sponsored by U.S. tobacco companies but attended by representatives of these companies; (2) the types of services officials can provide tobacco companies; and (3) the description of tobacco products, such as whether component parts for electronic cigarettes are included. Federal standards for internal control state that management should clearly document internal controls in policies and guidance to prevent officials from failing to achieve an objective or address a risk.

The VA medical centers also did not always conduct reviews in a timely manner, with some reviews taking years to initiate. The report attributed these issues to a lack of documentation requirements and timeliness standards in VHA policy and inadequate oversight by VHA networks.

The report recommended that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish a timeliness requirement, and strengthen oversight by requiring networks to oversee VA medical centers' reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards. VA concurred with these recommendations and plans to revise policies and update the standardized audit tool.", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's November 2017 report, entitled VA Health Care: Improved Policies and Oversight Needed for Reviewing and Reporting Providers for Quality and Safety Concerns ( GAO-18-63 ). Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1743, "token_length": 2766, "chunk_ppl": [25.265954971313477, 6.622316360473633, 3.707216739654541, 4.223372459411621, 4.318966865539551, 6.2981367111206055, 3.365619659423828, 5.016658306121826, 7.257046699523926, 6.749680042266846, 4.036493301391602, 5.435339450836182, 3.322535514831543, 5.269176959991455, 5.130252838134766, 3.8894588947296143, 7.483419418334961, 4.069357395172119], "total_ppl": 5.403061866760254, "block_sizes": [11, 30, 32, 21, 16, 10, 21, 23, 9, 32, 16, 12, 14, 16, 18, 32, 32, 24, 9, 12, 19, 20, 11, 32, 32, 10, 8, 14, 10, 15, 8, 10, 13, 11, 19, 16, 15, 32, 9, 15, 9, 15, 11, 12, 32, 10, 9, 15, 11, 8, 12, 22, 25, 12, 11, 11, 17, 8, 15, 8, 13, 11, 8, 11, 10, 11, 10, 15, 10, 12, 8, 14, 26, 11, 14, 11, 9, 28, 15, 8, 8, 14, 14, 10, 23, 13, 19, 9, 10, 12, 21, 8, 8], "mean_block_size": 15.118279569892474, "generation_time": 275.0102276802063}
{"id": 9, "pred": "The VA faces challenges in aligning its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans due to geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, an aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement. The VA's facility inventory includes 430 vacant or mostly vacant buildings and an additional 784 underutilized buildings, many of which are over 60 years old and historically significant. The historic status of some facilities complicates efforts to convert or dispose of them. VA has encountered challenges in engaging stakeholders, including veterans, local and federal officials, Veterans Service Organizations, historic preservation groups, VA staff, and Congress, which has resulted in adversarial relationships and reduced VA's ability to align facilities with veterans' needs. The VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and VA Integrated Planning (VAIP) processes have limitations, including long timeframes, restricted access to information, and subjective narratives, which hinder VA's ability to accurately identify the capital necessary to address service and facility needs. The report recommends that VA address identified limitations with the SCIP process, improve stakeholder communication, and assess the value of VAIP's facility master plans as a facility-planning tool. VA concurred with these recommendations but has not taken significant action to implement them. The report also suggests that Congress consider seven elements used by the Department of Defense in its Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process when evaluating proposed VA property disposal or realignment legislation.", "answers": ["VA operates one of the largest health care systems in the United States, utilizing more than 6,000 federally owned and 1,500 leased buildings. DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation. In the April 2017 report, GAO made recommendations related to capital planning and stakeholder involvement.

In the eastern DRC, armed groups have committed severe human rights abuses, including sexual violence, and reportedly profit from the exploitation of “conflict minerals”— in particular, tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold, according to the United Nations. Congress included a provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that, among other things, required the SEC to promulgate regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals from the DRC and adjoining countries. The SEC adopted these regulations in 2012. The act also included a provision for GAO to annually assess the SEC regulations' effectiveness in promoting peace and security and report on the rate of sexual violence in the DRC and adjoining countries. In this report, GAO provides information about (1) companies' conflict minerals disclosures filed with the SEC in 2017 compared with disclosures filed in the prior 2 years and (2) the rate of sexual violence in the eastern DRC and adjoining countries published in 2017 and early 2018. GAO analyzed a generalizable random sample of SEC filings and interviewed relevant officials. GAO reviewed U.S., United Nations, and international organizations' reports; interviewed DRC officials, and other stakeholders; and conducted fieldwork in New York at the United Nations headquarters. GAO is not making any recommendations. GAO's review of companies' conflict minerals disclosures filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2017 found that, in general, they were similar to disclosures filed in the prior 2 years. In 2017, 1,165 companies filed conflict minerals disclosures—about the same as in 2016 and 2015. Percentages of companies reporting country-of-origin inquiries in 2017 were also similar to the percentages from those 2 prior years. As a result of the inquiries they conducted, an estimated 53 percent of companies reported in 2017 whether the conflict minerals in their products came from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries—similar to the estimated 49 percent in 2016 and 2015 but significantly higher than the estimate of 30 percent in 2014 (see figure). In their 2017 disclosure reports, many companies described actions they took to improve data collection processes, and most companies indicated some challenges in determining the country of origin. Similar to the prior 2 years, almost all companies required to conduct due diligence, as a result of their country-of-origin inquiries, reported doing so. After conducting due diligence to determine the source and chain of custody of any conflict minerals used, an estimated 37 percent of these companies reported in 2017 that they were able to determine that their conflict minerals came from covered countries or from scrap or recycled sources, compared with 39 and 23 percent in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Four companies in GAO's sample declared their products “DRC conflict-free,” and of those, three included the required Independent Private Sector Audit report (IPSA), and one did not. In 2017, 16 companies filed an IPSA; 19 did so in 2016. GAO found information on the rate of sexual violence in the 2017 Uganda and Burundi Demographic and Health Surveys.

{"id": 11, "pred": "The report by the government agency, GAO, discusses the changes in size and composition of the Department of Defense (DOD) workforce since 2001. The military, civilian, and contractor workforces peaked around 2011 and have since decreased due to various factors such as U.S. involvement in conflicts, conversions, insourcing, and growth in certain workforces. The report highlights the importance of DOD Instruction 1100.22, which establishes policies and procedures for determining the appropriate workforce mix of military, civilian, and contracted services.\n\nThe report also discusses DOD's efforts to understand the costs associated with its workforces and the challenges in accounting for the full cost of federal civilian and contractor personnel. DOD used non-excludable contract costs as a basis for two of its methodologies but did not include all costs, such as indirect costs and costs to manage contracts. The report recommends that DOD and the Office of Personnel Management explore opportunities to refine, consolidate, or reduce unused, inefficient, or cumbersome hiring authorities to improve available workforce data and support better-informed leadership decisions.\n\nThe report concludes that DOD partially addressed the reporting element to compare the fully-burdened cost of federal civilian and service contractor personnel but did not account for all costs as required by the mandate. The report was sent to appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense, and other interested parties.", "answers": ["In addition to more than 2.2 million active duty and reserve personnel, DOD employs about 760,000 federal civilians and more than 560,000 contractors. In the Senate Report 114-49 accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision for DOD to issue a report (1) assessing functions performed by federal civilian and service contractor personnel, (2) accounting for the full costs of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing these functions, (3) comparing these costs, and (4) assessing available hiring and retention authorities for federal civilians. The Senate report also included a provision for GAO to assess DOD's report, which DOD submitted to Congress in April 2017. This report examines the extent to which DOD's report addressed the prescribed congressional elements. GAO reviewed DOD's report and compared it to the prescribed elements, examined documents relevant to DOD's cost estimating and comparison methodology, and interviewed DOD officials, including those in its Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation responsible for the calculations in DOD's report. In response to Congressional direction, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a report in April 2017 comparing the costs of federal civilian and service contractor personnel at select installations. The report addressed three out of four provision elements and partially addressed one, as discussed below. DOD concluded that neither federal civilians nor service contractors were predominately more or less expensive, with costs being dependent on position, location, and level of seniority. DOD noted that it used a non-probability based sample of personnel for its report, and the results are not generalizable. An assessment of performance of functions being performed by federal civilian and service contractor personnel at six military installations, with four being in the continental United States and two being outside the continental United States. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it developed a methodology to assess performance of functions performed by federal civilians and service contractors at 17 organizations within nine geographic regions including two locations outside the continental United States. DOD used data from the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System to identify military installations with large reported numbers of federal civilians. DOD determined that personnel need to perform at least 80 percent common tasks to be able to make a comparison. An accounting of the fully-burdened, or full, cost of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing functions at the selected installations including training, benefits, reimbursable costs, and facility overhead. GAO believes that DOD partially addressed this requirement because while it calculated the labor costs of selected federal civilian and service contractor full-time equivalents performing similar functions for organizations at government-owned facilities, it excluded certain non-labor costs from its calculations. A comparison of the costs of performance of these functions by federal civilians and service contractor personnel at the selected installations. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it compared calculated costs for selected federal civilians and service contractors performing similar functions at selected installations and included those comparisons in its report. An assessment of the flexible employment authorities for the employment and retention of federal civilian employees. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it sent questionnaires to DOD hiring officials and human resource professionals to collect information on flexible employment authorities and conducted interviews with these and human resource professionals at the same 17 organizations used for the cost comparison. Based on an analysis of the information collected, DOD's report included several conclusions regarding flexible hiring authorities and made one recommendation. GAO is not making any recommendations; however, DOD non-concurred with GAO's assessment that DOD partially addressed the element to account for the full cost of personnel.

{"id": 12, "pred": "The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is a government agency under the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that insures private mortgage lenders against borrower default on certain home mortgages. FHA was established in 1934 during the Great Depression to encourage lending for housing and stimulate the construction industry. FHA insures mortgages that meet its criteria, and its insurance protects lenders in case of borrower default. FHA is one of three federal mortgage insurance programs, along with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). FHA-insured mortgages have lower down payment requirements and less stringent credit history requirements than conventional mortgages, making them attractive to first-time homebuyers, lower- and moderate-income households, and minorities. FHA's market share in the mortgage market has fluctuated over the years, increasing during economic downturns and decreasing during economic upswings. The report provides background on FHA's history and market role and an overview of the eligibility and underwriting criteria for FHA-insured home loans. It also provides data on the number and dollar volume of mortgages that FHA insures and its market share in recent years. The report does not go into detail on the financial status of the FHA mortgage insurance fund.", "answers": ["The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), was created by the National Housing Act of 1934. FHA insures private lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on mortgages that meet certain criteria, thereby expanding the availability of mortgage credit beyond what may be available otherwise. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage, FHA is to repay the lender the remaining amount owed. A household that obtains an FHA-insured mortgage must meet FHA's eligibility and underwriting standards, including showing that it has sufficient income to repay a mortgage. FHA requires a minimum down payment of 3.5% from most borrowers, which is lower than the down payment required for many other types of mortgages. FHA-insured mortgages cannot exceed a statutory maximum mortgage amount, which varies by area and is based on area median house prices but cannot exceed a specified ceiling in high-cost areas. (The ceiling is set at $726,525 in high-cost areas in calendar year 2019.) Borrowers are charged fees, called mortgage insurance premiums, in exchange for the insurance. In FY2018, FHA insured over 1 million new mortgages (including both home purchase and refinance mortgages) with a combined principal balance of $209 billion. FHA's share of the mortgage market tends to vary with economic conditions and other factors. In the aftermath of the housing market turmoil that began around 2007 and a related contraction of mortgage lending, FHA insured a larger share of mortgages than it had in the preceding years. Its overall share of the mortgage market increased from about 3% in calendar year 2005 to a peak of 21% in 2009. Since that time, FHA's share of the mortgage market has decreased somewhat, though it remains higher than it was in the early 2000s. In calendar year 2017, FHA's overall share of the mortgage market was about 17%. FHA-insured mortgages, like all mortgages, experienced increased default rates during the housing downturn that began around 2007, leading to concerns about the stability of the FHA insurance fund for single-family mortgages, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). In response to these concerns, FHA adopted a number of policy changes in an attempt to limit risk to the MMI Fund.

{"id": 13, "pred": "The report by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) outlines the use of the Program Error Rate Measurement (PERM) to estimate the national Medicaid improper payment rate. Medicaid is identified as a high-priority program under the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002, and CMS uses PERM data to target program integrity activities and oversight of state Medicaid programs. The report details the PERM methodology, which includes reviews of FFS claims, capitated payments to managed care organizations (MCOs), and eligibility determinations. The FFS component involves medical reviews of services and payments, while the managed care component focuses on the accuracy of capitated payments made to MCOs. The eligibility component, which assesses errors in state determinations of enrollee eligibility, has not been calculated since 2014. The report highlights the need for better information about program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care, as the current PERM methodology may underestimate these risks. The report also mentions various activities undertaken by CMS and states to improve oversight of Medicaid managed care. Overall, the report emphasizes the importance of addressing unidentified overpayments and unallowable costs in Medicaid managed care to ensure the integrity of the whole Medicaid program.", "answers": ["The improper payment rate is a sentinel measure of program integrity risks for the Medicaid program. CMS and the states oversee Medicaid, whose size, structure, and diversity make it vulnerable to improper payments. CMS estimates the Medicaid improper payment rate annually through its PERM, which includes an estimate for Medicaid managed care, in which states contract with MCOs to provide services to Medicaid enrollees. GAO was asked to study the PERM methodology for managed care. In this report, GAO examined the extent to which the PERM accounts for program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care, including CMS's and states' oversight. GAO identified program integrity risks reported in 27 federal and state audits and investigations issued between January 2012 and September 2017; reviewed federal regulations and guidance on the PERM and CMS's Focused Program Integrity Reviews; and contacted program integrity officials in the 16 states with a majority of 2016 Medicaid spending for managed care, as well as CMS officials and program integrity experts. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) estimate of improper payments for Medicaid managed care has limitations that are not mitigated by the agency's and states' current oversight efforts. One component of the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) measures the accuracy of capitated payments, which are periodic payments that state Medicaid agencies make to managed care organizations (MCO) to provide services to enrollees and to cover other allowable costs, such as administrative expenses. However, the managed care component of the PERM neither includes a medical review of services delivered to enrollees, nor reviews of MCO records or data. Further, GAO's review of the 27 federal and state audits and investigations identified key program risks. Ten of the 27 federal and state audits and investigations identified about $68 million in overpayments and unallowable MCO costs that were not accounted for by PERM estimates; another of these investigations resulted in a $137.5 million settlement. These audits and investigations were conducted over more than 5 years and involved a small fraction of the more than 270 MCOs operating nationwide as of September 2017. To the extent that overpayments and unallowable costs are unidentified and not removed from the cost data used to set capitation rates, they may allow inflated MCO payments and minimize the appearance of program risks in Medicaid managed care. CMS and states have taken steps to improve oversight of Medicaid managed care through updated regulations, focused reviews of states' managed care programs, and federal program integrity contractors' audits of managed care services. However, some of these efforts went into effect only recently, and others are unlikely to address the risks in managed care across all states. Furthermore, these efforts do not ensure the identification and reporting of overpayments to providers and unallowable costs by MCOs. Federal internal control standards call for agency management to identify and respond to risks. Without addressing key risks, such as the extent of overpayments and unallowable costs, CMS cannot be certain that its estimated improper payment rate for managed care (0.3 percent compared with 12.9 percent in Medicaid fee-for-service) accurately reflects program risks. The Administrator of CMS should consider and take steps to mitigate the program risks that are not measured in the PERM, such as overpayments and unallowable costs; such an effort could include actions such as revising the PERM methodology or focusing additional audit resources on managed care.

During FY2017, the RRB paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to approximately 548,000 beneficiaries and paid $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits to approximately 28,000 claimants. Of the total $12.5 billion benefit payments in the same fiscal year, 60.0% was paid to retired workers, 8.0% to disabled workers, 14.4% to spouses, and 16.8% to survivors. The Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) authorizes retirement, disability, and survivor benefits for railroad workers and their families. RRA is financed primarily by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). Railroad retirement payroll taxes have two tiers: the Tier I tax is essentially the same as the Social Security payroll tax and the Tier II tax is set each year based on the railroad retirement system's asset balances, benefit payments, and administrative costs. In FY2017, the gross RRA funding was about $12.7 billion. Railroad retirement annuities are also divided into two tiers. Tier I annuities are designed to be nearly equivalent to Social Security benefits and are based on both railroad retirement and Social Security-covered employment. However, Tier I annuities are more generous than Social Security benefits in certain situations. For example, at the age of 60, railroad workers with at least 30 years of covered railroad work may receive unreduced retirement annuities. Tier II annuities are similar to private pensions and based solely on covered railroad service. Tier II annuities are paid in addition to Tier I annuities. Railroad disability annuities may be payable to totally disabled railroad workers who are permanently disabled from all work and occupational disabled workers who are found to be permanently disabled from their regular railroad occupations. Eligible spouses and survivors of railroad workers may receive a certain portion of Tier I and Tier II benefits, but divorced spouses and surviving divorced spouses are eligible for only a certain portion of Tier I benefits. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) authorizes unemployment and sickness benefits for railroad workers. RUIA is financed solely by railroad employers, whose contributions are based on the taxable earnings of their employees. Eligibility for railroad unemployment and sickness benefits is based on recent railroad service and earnings.

{"id": 15, "pred": "The report outlines the importance of the global defense posture in enabling U.S. military activities and communications of strategic interests to allies, partners, and adversaries. The defense posture is guided by the National Defense Strategy and National Military Strategy and consists of three elements: forces, footprint, and agreements. EUCOM is responsible for evaluating the adequacy of posture in Europe and shares responsibility for military relations with allies and NATO. The report highlights the decrease in U.S. military presence in Europe since the end of the Cold War, with only one airborne infantry brigade and one Stryker brigade, and approximately 62,000 military personnel across approximately 250 sites.\n\nThe report also discusses the challenges in estimating and reporting the total cost of the global defense posture, specifically in Europe, and the lack of comprehensive cost data in key planning documents. The report recommends that the Secretary of Defense prioritize posture initiatives under the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) relative to those in the base budget, develop estimates for the sustainment costs of prepositioned equipment and infrastructure projects under ERI, and provide future cost estimates and assumptions to Congress.\n\nThe report also mentions that EUCOM identified five lines of effort under ERI, three of which are expected to enhance DOD's posture in Europe by increasing forces present, improving infrastructure, and negotiating host nation agreements. The report notes that DOD has requested increased funding for ERI and is working to provide Congress with more information on the future costs and assumptions of the initiative. The report concludes by mentioning that the Army and Air Force identified approximately $224 million in minor military construction and repair projects funded under ERI from fiscal years 2015 through 2017.", "answers": ["In response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014, the President announced the ERI, to reassure allies in Europe of U.S. commitment to their security. This initiative has been funded using OCO appropriations, which Congress provides in addition to DOD's base budget appropriations. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, included a provision for GAO to review matters related to ERI. In this report, we (1) describe changes in ERI's objectives, funding under ERI, and DOD's posture in Europe since 2014 and (2) evaluate the extent to which DOD's planning processes for posture initiatives funded under ERI prioritize those initiatives, estimate their long-term costs, and communicate their estimated costs to Congress. GAO analyzed DOD strategy documentation, budget and cost analysis guidance, budget justification materials, and cost and obligations data. GAO also interviewed knowledgeable officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. European Command, the military services, and the State Department. Since 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) has expanded the European Reassurance Initiative's (ERI) objectives, increased its funding, and planned enhancements to European posture. DOD expanded ERI's objectives from the short-term reassurance of allies and partners to include deterring Russian aggression in the long term and developing the capacity to field a credible combined force should deterrence fail. With respect to funding, DOD will have requested approximately $4.5 billion for ERI's posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017 (about $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2017 alone), and in July 2016 EUCOM identified funding needs for future posture initiatives. The expansion of ERI's objectives has contributed to DOD's enhancing its posture in Europe. Specifically, DOD has increased the size and duration of Army combat unit deployments, planned to preposition Army equipment in Eastern Europe, added new enduring locations (e.g., locations that DOD expects to access and use to support U.S. security interests for the foreseeable future), improved infrastructure, and negotiated new agreements with European nations. As of April 2017, DOD was considering further force enhancements under ERI as part of the department's ERI budget request. DOD also was reviewing whether new enduring locations to support ERI were needed and was considering other improvements to existing infrastructure. DOD's process for planning ERI has not established priorities among posture initiatives funded under ERI relative to those in its base budget, nor estimated long-term sustainment costs for some posture initiatives funded under ERI, nor communicated future costs to Congress. ERI is being planned using a separate process from DOD's established processes and is funded from DOD's overseas contingency operations (OCO) appropriations. GAO found several weaknesses: Lack of prioritization : DOD establishes priorities among ERI posture initiatives but has not evaluated them against base budget initiatives using its posture management process. As a result, DOD lacks an understanding of the relative importance of ERI initiatives and may be investing in projects that it will not continue should OCO funding become unavailable. Lack of sustainment costs : EUCOM and the military services have not fully estimated the long-term costs to sustain equipment and construction funded under ERI. Based on DOD's approach for calculating rough order sustainment costs, GAO determined that these costs could be substantial. DOD officials said that GAO correctly applied DOD's approach for estimating sustainment costs, but noted that actual costs may be lower, because the military services may not fully fund sustainment. In the absence of comprehensive estimates, DOD has been limited in its ability to assess affordability and plan for future costs. Not communicating future costs : DOD limits Congress's visibility into the resources needed to implement ERI and achieve its objectives because it does not include future costs in its ERI budget request. This is a public version of a classified report issued in August 2017. Information on specific posture planning, guidance, and budget estimates that DOD deemed to be classified have been omitted from this report. GAO recommends that DOD prioritize ERI posture initiatives against initiatives in its base budget, develop cost estimates for sustaining initiatives, and communicate future costs to Congress. DOD partially concurred with GAO's recommendations. GAO continues to believe that these recommendations are warranted."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5106, "token_length": 7577, "chunk_ppl": [20.83781623840332, 14.881194114685059, 5.0416364669799805, 6.504465579986572, 8.481012344360352, 5.575395584106445, 5.631677627563477, 7.174659729003906, 6.820207595825195, 4.842844486236572, 6.117562294006348, 6.889411449432373, 5.824676990509033, 5.337172985076904, 6.692996978759766, 8.97998332977295, 9.19229793548584, 8.1302490234375, 7.88098669052124, 3.4475767612457275, 8.368648529052734, 6.1096649169921875, 5.762284278869629, 5.3219685554504395, 9.9430570602417, 4.838902950286865, 5.788107395172119, 5.413883209228516, 4.071699619293213, 3.985133171081543, 8.065457344055176, 6.85631799697876, 6.210655212402344, 8.012948036193848, 6.416889667510986, 7.05435037612915, 4.764533519744873, 6.195225715637207, 7.205475807189941, 7.858610153198242, 6.319777965545654, 9.03607177734375, 7.712851047515869, 5.175233840942383, 4.572315692901611, 7.15716552734375, 6.7850165367126465, 3.3652913570404053, 9.254759788513184, 5.692804336547852, 5.765121936798096, 3.4791107177734375, 4.256598949432373, 5.779036998748779, 17.91701316833496, 45.325626373291016], "total_ppl": 6.571147918701172, "block_sizes": [14, 27, 22, 17, 10, 9, 9, 8, 16, 9, 21, 15, 32, 15, 9, 32, 15, 32, 8, 32, 32, 13, 13, 32, 9, 8, 13, 11, 9, 10, 8, 8, 32, 14, 8, 32, 28, 25, 20, 9, 25, 11, 9, 8, 25, 13, 15, 21, 10, 16, 10, 9, 17, 9, 9, 17, 8, 9, 13, 12, 12, 8, 10, 12, 11, 17, 15, 13, 12, 11, 32, 11, 11, 15, 19, 20, 15, 12, 9, 17, 14, 15, 15, 21, 8, 18, 21, 25, 24, 8, 8, 20, 8, 12, 8, 14, 14, 31, 10, 10, 8, 10, 12, 11, 11, 9, 10, 15, 19, 10, 22, 8, 9, 11, 9, 9, 11, 26, 24, 10, 11, 8, 11, 9, 18, 10, 18, 8, 8, 8, 13, 18, 8, 13, 15, 10, 10, 21, 32, 8, 11, 12, 9, 12, 8, 10, 9, 18, 10, 20, 9, 16, 12, 15, 20, 9, 17, 9, 9, 11, 16, 10, 12, 9, 26, 13, 14, 11, 17, 23, 13, 11, 32, 8, 23, 12, 8, 14, 24, 8, 10, 10, 9, 12, 22, 13, 10, 29, 13, 24, 12, 9, 13, 9, 29, 18, 11, 10, 31, 21, 18, 20, 15, 10, 10, 17, 13, 28, 9, 11, 9, 10, 25, 9, 10, 9, 10, 22, 19, 32, 9, 22, 11, 9, 16, 8, 12, 18, 13, 14, 11, 13, 29, 13, 8, 10, 16, 12, 16, 24, 21, 11, 12, 12, 9, 32, 14, 32, 19, 10, 14, 26, 22, 15, 20, 9, 8, 12, 10, 14, 11, 12, 13, 10, 9, 11, 8, 10, 18, 8, 14, 12, 10, 11, 16, 8, 8, 8, 13, 11, 13, 8, 10, 10, 11, 8, 18, 9, 14, 15, 9, 18, 13, 12, 21, 20, 9, 10, 15, 21, 15, 18, 13, 13, 9, 8, 9, 14, 16, 22, 8, 12, 19, 12, 15, 8, 9, 20, 21, 8, 14, 32, 14, 9, 9, 8, 17, 14, 17, 14, 24, 16, 9, 11, 8, 9, 11, 8, 8, 14, 15, 14, 8, 14, 17, 8, 13, 15, 9, 20, 21, 10, 14, 8, 16, 12, 11, 13, 22, 9, 8, 8, 30, 9, 9, 8, 9, 12, 10, 9, 8, 12, 15, 10, 15, 11, 11, 13, 32, 9, 11, 26, 10, 11, 12, 9, 21, 8, 12, 11, 32, 10, 12, 12, 13, 20, 21, 13, 19, 17, 14, 32, 8, 24, 22, 11, 8, 11, 10, 13, 15, 11, 9, 13, 9, 23, 12, 10, 9, 11, 14, 8, 11, 30, 11, 15, 32, 24, 13, 12, 8, 11, 12, 16, 10, 8, 10, 11, 25, 13, 11, 24, 32, 10, 22, 18], "mean_block_size": 14.23542600896861, "generation_time": 539.6275427341461}

{"id": 17, "pred": "The report discusses the Commercial Space Launch Act Amendments of 1988, which established the U.S. policy for providing federal payment for third-party claims resulting from commercial launch or reentry accidents. The goal was to create a competitive environment for the U.S. commercial space launch industry while minimizing taxpayer costs. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issues licenses for commercial launches and reentries, and determines minimum property damage liability (MPL) values to reflect the greatest expected losses from accidents. In 2016, FAA issued five licenses with an average MPL of $51 million. The report highlights that FAA's methodology for calculating MPL values, including estimating the number of casualties and property damage, has not been fully updated since the 1990s. The report recommends that FAA reevaluate its MPL methodology, including the probability thresholds, cost impact, and consultation with industry stakeholders, to ensure a balance of risk and minimize federal exposure to liability costs. The report also recommends that FAA establish a completion date for developing and implementing a plan to update the cost-of-casualty amount. The Department of Transportation concurred with the recommendations.", "answers": ["The federal government shares liability risks with the commercial space launch industry for accidents that result in damages to third parties or federal property. This arrangement requires space launch companies to have a specific amount of insurance to cover these damages. The government is potentially liable for damages above that amount, up to a cap GAO estimated to be $3.1 billion in 2017, subject to appropriations in advance. CSLCA, enacted in 2015, directed the Department of Transportation, of which FAA is a part, to evaluate its MPL methodology and, if necessary, develop a plan to update that methodology. The act also included a provision requiring GAO to assess FAA's evaluation and any actions needed to update the methodology. This report discusses the extent to which (1) FAA's evaluation report addresses the requirements in CSLCA and (2) FAA has addressed previously identified weaknesses in the MPL methodology. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed FAA on its loss methodology evaluation and actions to address weaknesses. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) report evaluating its maximum probable loss (MPL) methodology did not fully address the evaluation and consultation requirements specified by the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (CSLCA). Balance of Risk. CSLCA required FAA to include ensuring that the federal government is not exposed to greater indemnification costs and that launch companies are not required to purchase more insurance coverage than necessary as a result of FAA's MPL methodology. FAA said that it ensured this balance by improving its methodology, but it did not reevaluate its probability thresholds after revising its methodology. These thresholds are used to divide the risk of loss between launch companies and the government. Impact on Costs. The act required FAA to consider the costs to both the industry and the federal government of implementing an updated methodology. FAA's report discussed the impact on indirect costs, such as data collection, but did not discuss direct costs: insurance premiums for launch companies and indemnification liability for the federal government. Consultation. The act also required FAA to consult with the commercial space sector and insurance providers in evaluating its MPL methodology in accordance with the preceding requirements. While the agency consulted with some stakeholders, these consultations were limited in scope. FAA officials said they have not been able to take the actions needed to fully satisfy the mandated elements because of issues such as resource limitations and the lack of available data. However, by not resolving these issues, FAA lacks assurance that launch companies are not purchasing more insurance than needed or that the federal government is not being exposed to greater indemnification costs than expected. FAA has addressed two of three previously identified weaknesses in its MPL methodology but has not yet dealt with the remaining weakness. Specifically, the agency has revised its methodology for estimating the number of potential casualties for a launch and changed the factor it uses to derive estimated property damage from estimated casualties. However, FAA has not updated the amount used for the cost of an individual casualty. GAO recommended in a March 2017 report (GAO-17-366) that FAA update this amount. Not doing so could understate the amount of insurance launch companies are required to purchase, exposing the federal government to excess risk. GAO also determined that while FAA has two tools and methods it can use in making its MPL estimates, it does not have guidance on determining which are most appropriate for a given launch scenario. For example, one tool is more comprehensive but also labor intensive to use, while the other is inappropriate for certain launch scenarios and could result in misleading MPL amounts. Officials said they have begun to create such guidance but do not have an estimated completion date. Without such guidance, FAA cannot ensure that the most appropriate MPL methodology is used for each launch. FAA should fully address mandated requirements in evaluating its MPL—probability thresholds, direct costs, and stakeholder consultations— and establish an estimated completion date for developing guidance on tools and methods to use for specific launch scenarios.

To ensure that the Coast Guard is effectively fulfilling its missions, agency managers must have accurate information and base decisions on sound analyses for effective program management. This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made recommendations to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult trade off decisions it will face given funding constraints. The Coast Guard agreed, but it is unclear when it will complete the 20-year plan. GAO is not making new recommendations in this statement but has made them to the Coast Guard and DHS in the past on improving its program management through, among other things, better quality and more transparent data.

Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W. Bush Administration sought $313.1 million; the appropriation was $101.3 million. The appropriation for other purposes last exceeded $100.0 million in FY2010, and most recently was $93.3 million, in FY2019. Prior to FY2008, several other purposes typically were funded each year from LWCF. Since FY2008, funds have been appropriated annually only for grants under two programs: Forest Legacy and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. These two programs and a third grant program—State and Tribal Wildlife Grants—have received more than three-quarters ($2.1 billion, 79%) of the total appropriation for other purposes since FY1998."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2138, "token_length": 3838, "chunk_ppl": [11.876602172851562, 7.895442008972168, 4.934021949768066, 4.354681968688965, 8.531451225280762, 3.6574432849884033, 4.9860453605651855, 6.848667621612549, 5.606591701507568, 7.522372722625732, 5.476926803588867, 4.5966949462890625, 4.065129280090332, 4.207164287567139, 6.041513442993164, 5.221374988555908, 3.1867382526397705, 3.7469284534454346, 6.243136882781982, 5.917916297912598, 4.0455403327941895, 5.003946781158447, 5.91671895980835, 5.705842018127441, 5.112122058868408, 5.817748069763184], "total_ppl": 5.399742603302002, "block_sizes": [9, 8, 8, 8, 11, 20, 22, 11, 11, 32, 8, 29, 12, 13, 23, 19, 13, 16, 23, 9, 10, 32, 32, 18, 32, 16, 8, 9, 11, 15, 11, 11, 14, 9, 10, 23, 10, 32, 17, 9, 9, 30, 8, 13, 9, 14, 27, 32, 32, 16, 10, 9, 14, 8, 12, 22, 9, 10, 8, 20, 9, 23, 10, 15, 16, 11, 9, 9, 11, 14, 15, 12, 11, 18, 8, 24, 12, 8, 19, 8, 8, 11, 9, 32, 13, 8, 16, 11, 14, 8, 11, 17, 29, 8, 15, 32, 11, 10, 8, 17, 13, 19, 10, 21, 8, 9, 13, 14, 10, 10, 32, 32, 9, 11, 10, 15, 23, 11, 8, 11, 8, 11, 18, 9, 12, 8, 8, 11, 24, 8, 14, 15, 11, 13, 8, 12, 19, 14, 28, 9, 10, 22, 9, 10, 31, 13, 9, 18, 23, 22, 19, 8, 14, 9, 11, 9, 11, 8, 13, 14, 11, 18, 9, 21, 9, 11, 14, 8, 18, 8, 18], "mean_block_size": 14.461988304093568, "generation_time": 310.7057259082794}
{"id": 20, "pred": "The report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlights the Navy's significant mishaps at sea since 2017, resulting in serious damage to Navy ships and the loss of 17 sailors. Three of these mishaps occurred with ships homeported overseas in Yokosuka, Japan. The Navy, which currently has 277 ships, a 17 percent reduction from 1998, has been deploying more ships to maintain the same level of presence, leading to persistently low readiness levels and increased deployment lengths. This, in turn, has resulted in declining ship conditions and difficulty keeping crews fully trained and ships maintained. The Navy has been homeporting more ships overseas to provide forward presence and rapid crisis response, but this comes at a cost of higher operations and support costs and limited training and maintenance periods. The Navy has faced challenges in implementing its revised operational schedule to address these issues and has extended its time frame for readiness recovery to at least 2021. The report recommends that the Navy develop and implement a sustainable operational schedule for all ships homeported overseas, reassess the factors used in its manpower requirements process, and update its ship manning requirements. The Department of Defense concurred with these recommendations but has not yet taken any actions to implement them. The report also mentions several previous GAO reports with recommendations related to Navy readiness, of which only one has been implemented to date.", "answers": ["Since January 2017, the Navy has suffered four significant mishaps at sea that resulted in serious damage to its ships and the loss of 17 sailors. Three of these incidents involved ships homeported in Japan. In response to these incidents, the Chief of Naval Operations ordered an operational pause for all fleets worldwide, and the Vice Chief of Naval Operations directed a comprehensive review of surface fleet operations, stating that these tragic incidents are not limited occurrences but part of a disturbing trend in mishaps involving U.S. ships. This statement provides information on the effects of homeporting ships overseas, reducing crew size on ships, and not completing maintenance on time on the readiness of the Navy and summarizes GAO recommendations to address the Navy's maintenance, training, and other challenges. In preparing this statement, GAO relied on work it has published since 2015 related to the readiness of ships homeported overseas, sailor training and workload issues, maintenance challenges, and other issues. GAO updated this information, as appropriate, based on Navy data. GAO's prior work shows that the Navy has increased deployment lengths, shortened training periods, and reduced or deferred maintenance to meet high operational demands, which has resulted in declining ship conditions and a worsening trend in overall readiness. The Navy has stated that high demand for presence has put pressure on a fleet that is stretched thin across the globe. Some of the concerns that GAO has highlighted include: Degraded readiness of ships homeported overseas: Since 2006, the Navy has doubled the number of ships based overseas. Overseas basing provides additional forward presence and rapid crisis response, but GAO found in May 2015 that there were no dedicated training periods built into the operational schedules of the cruisers and destroyers based in Japan. As a result, the crews of these ships did not have all of their needed training and certifications. Based on updated data, GAO found that, as of June 2017, 37 percent of the warfare certifications for cruiser and destroyer crews based in Japan—including certifications for seamanship—had expired. This represents more than a fivefold increase in the percentage of expired warfare certifications for these ships since GAO's May 2015 report. The Navy has made plans to revise operational schedules to provide dedicated training time for overseas-based ships, but this schedule has not yet been implemented. Crew size reductions contribute to sailor overwork and safety risks: GAO found in May 2017 that reductions to crew sizes the Navy made in the early 2000s were not analytically supported and may now be creating safety risks. The Navy has reversed some of those changes but continues to use a workweek standard that does not reflect the actual time sailors spend working and does not account for in-port workload—both of which have contributed to some sailors working over 100 hours a week. Inability to complete maintenance on time: Navy recovery from persistently low readiness levels is premised on adherence to maintenance schedules. However, in May 2016, GAO found that the Navy was having difficulty completing maintenance on time. Based on updated data, GAO found that, in fiscal years 2011 through 2016, maintenance overruns on 107 of 169 surface ships (63 percent) resulted in 6,603 lost operational days (i.e., the ships were not available for training and operations). Looking to the future, the Navy wants to grow its fleet by as much as 30 percent but continues to face challenges with manning, training, and maintaining its existing fleet. These readiness problems need to be addressed and will require the Navy to implement GAO's recommendations—particularly in the areas of assessing the risks associated with overseas basing, reassessing sailor workload and the factors used to size ship crews, managing investments to modernize and improve the efficiency of the naval shipyards, and applying sound planning and sustained management attention to its readiness rebuilding efforts. In addition, continued congressional oversight will be needed to ensure that the Navy demonstrates progress in addressing its maintenance, training, and other challenges. GAO made 14 recommendations in prior work cited in this statement. The Department of Defense generally concurred with all of them but has implemented only 1. Continued attention is needed to ensure that these recommendations are addressed, such as the Navy assessing the risks associated with overseas basing and reassessing sailor workload and factors used in its manpower requirements process."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3534, "token_length": 5772, "chunk_ppl": [14.97211742401123, 5.139768123626709, 4.916746616363525, 7.582880973815918, 3.8559107780456543, 6.48785924911499, 7.624149799346924, 5.883449077606201, 4.436651229858398, 4.2960920333862305, 7.1432905197143555, 5.801130771636963, 7.108357906341553, 6.22681999206543, 6.851500511169434, 9.49095344543457, 8.599432945251465, 9.667232513427734, 5.953096866607666, 6.238813400268555, 8.199295997619629, 6.307476043701172, 3.443835735321045, 1.7745059728622437, 4.756186008453369, 6.3291916847229, 9.962814331054688, 10.264570236206055, 5.422781944274902, 7.522153854370117, 7.090707778930664, 8.082091331481934, 5.182702541351318, 17.49741554260254, 5.876496315002441, 6.399593353271484, 3.7275967597961426, 3.0314393043518066, 2.9731340408325195, 2.845491647720337, 2.3049447536468506, 391.51678466796875], "total_ppl": 5.9459686279296875, "block_sizes": [11, 8, 15, 10, 32, 32, 31, 10, 8, 22, 13, 8, 10, 18, 10, 27, 32, 23, 15, 15, 9, 11, 16, 10, 17, 16, 14, 19, 18, 32, 11, 12, 19, 13, 10, 14, 16, 32, 14, 9, 8, 15, 32, 8, 18, 8, 12, 12, 12, 8, 16, 8, 16, 8, 10, 14, 9, 10, 16, 8, 8, 9, 17, 12, 12, 11, 10, 11, 26, 32, 10, 15, 11, 15, 20, 17, 32, 8, 13, 22, 11, 9, 11, 9, 30, 10, 17, 8, 8, 10, 9, 23, 10, 11, 18, 8, 21, 17, 9, 18, 11, 15, 18, 9, 11, 8, 22, 9, 19, 12, 8, 21, 13, 8, 14, 11, 12, 9, 15, 27, 16, 11, 8, 8, 13, 10, 13, 20, 18, 11, 14, 12, 13, 11, 9, 17, 12, 20, 9, 15, 11, 9, 8, 15, 17, 9, 11, 9, 11, 13, 10, 17, 8, 8, 18, 13, 14, 23, 15, 9, 9, 9, 13, 13, 13, 12, 8, 30, 12, 32, 14, 14, 8, 11, 8, 13, 8, 12, 9, 10, 8, 18, 10, 32, 10, 16, 10, 23, 16, 23, 15, 14, 17, 8, 10, 9, 15, 12, 23, 9, 8, 32, 32, 21, 32, 32, 24, 24, 9, 8, 20, 9, 9, 18, 21, 20, 10, 8, 8, 16, 9, 8, 14, 16, 11, 8, 8, 12, 10, 10, 8, 8, 13, 12, 12, 8, 11, 8, 11, 10, 12, 8, 10, 8, 11, 10, 8, 9, 13, 9, 9, 13, 10, 21, 22, 12, 21, 12, 8, 11, 8, 13, 12, 8, 10, 11, 8, 11, 11, 10, 15, 15, 11, 12, 8, 12, 8, 9, 9, 14, 19, 12, 11, 9, 16, 11, 11, 27, 17, 9, 8, 8, 10, 8, 9, 9, 18, 13, 11, 8, 32, 15, 28, 10, 24, 11, 8, 10, 10, 10, 9, 10, 8, 17, 11, 9, 32, 17, 9, 12, 8, 11, 10, 32, 9, 9, 9], "mean_block_size": 13.663608562691131, "generation_time": 425.4135720729828}

The United States is the largest contributor of funding and personnel to Resolute Support, providing and maintaining ANDSF equipment, along with training, advising, and assistance to help the ANDSF effectively use and sustain the equipment in the future. House Report 114-537 included a provision for GAO to review the ANDSF's capability and capacity to operate and sustain U.S.-purchased weapon systems and equipment. This report addresses (1) what has been reported about ANDSF capabilities and capability gaps and (2) the extent to which DOD has information about the ANDSF's ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed DOD and NATO reports and documents, examined three critical equipment types, and interviewed DOD officials in the United States and Afghanistan. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in September 2018. Information that DOD deemed sensitive has been omitted. Since the Resolute Support mission began in 2015, the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have improved some fundamental capabilities, such as high-level operational planning, but continue to rely on U.S. and coalition support to fill several key capability gaps, according to Department of Defense (DOD) reporting. DOD has initiatives to address some ANDSF capability gaps, such as a country-wide vehicle maintenance and training effort, but DOD reports it does not expect the ANDSF to develop and sustain independent capabilities in some areas, such as logistics, for several years. While DOD has firsthand information on the abilities of the Afghan Air Force and Special Security Forces to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment, it has little reliable information on the equipment proficiency of conventional ANDSF units. U.S. and coalition advisors are embedded at the tactical level for the Air Force and Special Security Forces, enabling DOD to directly assess those forces' abilities. However, the advisors have little direct contact with conventional ANDSF units on the front lines. As a result, DOD relies on those units' self-assessments of tactical abilities, which, according to DOD officials, can be unreliable. GAO's analysis of three critical equipment types illustrated the varying degrees of DOD's information (see figure above). For example, DOD provided detailed information about the Air Force's ability to operate and maintain MD-530 helicopters and the Special Security Forces' ability to operate and maintain Mobile Strike Force Vehicles; however, DOD had limited information about how conventional forces operate and maintain radios and Mobile Strike Force Vehicles.

{"id": 22, "pred": "The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 established the Choice Program, providing $10 billion in funding for veterans to receive health care services from community providers when facing long wait times or travel distances. The Choice Program was administered by two Third-Party Administrators (TPAs), Health Net and TriWest, who managed networks of community providers, scheduled appointments, and paid providers for their services. The Choice Program received additional funding of $9.4 billion in 2017 and 2018, but will sunset in June 2019.\n\nThe report highlights the importance of the Choice Program in providing care to veterans when VA facilities are unable to do so in a timely manner. The TPAs, Health Net and TriWest, were responsible for managing networks of community providers, scheduling appointments, and processing and paying claims. VA contracts with the TPAs did not include a payment timeliness requirement, and VA officials acknowledged that they did not enforce the customer service requirements for community providers' calls.\n\nThe report found that VA made untimely payments to the TPAs, which resulted in insufficient funds for community providers to pay their own expenses, leading to delays in care. The report also identified three key factors affecting the timeliness of claim payments to community providers: VA's untimely payments of TPA invoices, Choice Program contractual requirements related to provider reimbursement, and inadequate provider education on filing Choice Program claims.\n\nThe report recommends that the Undersecretary for Health monitor data on SAR approval decision time frames to ensure VA medical facilities are adhering to VA policy and take corrective actions as necessary. Additionally, the Undersecretary for Health should collect data and monitor compliance with the Choice Program contractual requirements pertaining to customer service for community providers and take corrective actions as necessary.\n\nThe report concludes that VA and its TPAs have taken steps to address the issues identified, including implementing new software for managing authorizations and provider education programs. However, continued nonadherence to VA's SAR approval policy and poor customer service reported by community providers pose risks to the Choice Program and the forthcoming Veterans Community Care Program.", "answers": ["Questions have been raised about the lack of timeliness of TPAs' payments to community providers under the Choice Program and how this may affect the willingness of providers to participate in the program as well as in the forthcoming Veterans Community Care Program. You asked GAO to review issues related to the timeliness of TPAs' payments to community providers under the Choice Program. This report examines, among other things, (1) the length of time TPAs have taken to pay community providers' claims and factors affecting timeliness of payments, and (2) actions taken by VA and the TPAs to reduce the length of time TPAs take to pay community providers for Choice Program claims. GAO reviewed TPA data on the length of time taken to pay community provider claims from November 2014 through June 2018, the most recent data available at the time of GAO's review. GAO also reviewed documentation, such as the contracts between VA and its TPAs, and interviewed VA and TPA officials. In addition, GAO interviewed a non-generalizable sample of 15 community providers, selected based on their large Choice Program claims volume, to learn about their experiences with payment timeliness. The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Choice Program (Choice Program) was created in 2014 to address problems with veterans' timely access to care at VA medical facilities. The Choice Program allows eligible veterans to obtain health care services from providers not directly employed by VA (community providers), who are then reimbursed for their services through one of the program's two third-party administrators (TPA). GAO's analysis of TPA data available for November 2014 through June 2018 shows that the length of time the TPAs took to pay community providers' clean claims each month varied widely—from 7 days to 68 days. VA and its TPAs identified several key factors affecting timeliness of payments to community providers under the Choice Program, including VA's untimely payments to TPAs, which in turn extended the length of time TPAs took to pay community providers' claims; and inadequate provider education on filing claims. VA has taken actions to address key factors that have contributed to the length of time TPAs have taken to pay community providers. For example, VA updated its payment system and related processes to pay TPAs more quickly. According to VA data, as of July 2018, VA was paying at least 90 percent of the TPAs' invoices within 7 days. In addition, VA and the TPAs have taken steps to improve provider education to help providers resolve claims processing issues. However, 9 of the 15 providers GAO interviewed said they continue to experience lengthy telephone hold times. According to VA and TPA officials, steps have been taken to improve the customer service offered to community providers. However, VA officials do not collect data on or monitor TPA compliance with customer service requirements—such as calls being answered within 30 seconds or less—for provider calls because they said they are not enforcing the requirements and are allowing TPAs to prioritize calls from veterans. Without collecting data and monitoring compliance, VA does not have information on challenges providers may face when contacting TPAs to resolve payment issues. GAO is making two recommendations, including that VA should collect data on and monitor compliance with its requirements pertaining to customer service for community providers.

{"id": 23, "pred": "The report outlines the steps required of executive branch agencies under the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPEA), as amended by IPERA and IPERIA, to address improper payments in their programs. These steps include identifying susceptible programs, developing improper payment estimates, analyzing root causes, and reporting results. Agencies must use statistically valid or alternative sampling approaches to estimate improper payments, and OMB provides guidance on this process. Six agencies were reviewed, and their processes for estimating improper payments varied. Some agencies, such as DOD for Military Pay and OPM for Retirement, had limited approaches and may not be fully addressing key risks like eligibility. OMB is required to issue guidance on how agencies test to identify improper payments, and the report recommends that OMB develop such guidance to help ensure agencies address specific risks before estimates are developed. The report also recommends that OMB clarify the appropriate treatment of nonresponse cases during improper payment testing. The six agencies reviewed reported using statistically valid or alternative sampling approaches, and some incorporated actual improper payment amounts into their estimates. The report concludes that improper payments are a significant issue in the federal government, and effective estimation and correction are crucial. The report makes recommendations to the Director of OMB for developing guidance on testing procedures and nonresponse cases, and specific recommendations to DOD, OPM, and IRS for addressing risks in their programs.", "answers": ["Improper payments—which include payments that should not have been made or were made in an incorrect amount—are a long-standing, significant problem in the federal government, estimated at almost $141 billion for fiscal year 2017. Executive branch agencies are required to annually estimate improper payments for certain programs. Estimation of improper payments is key to understanding the extent of the problem and to developing effective corrective actions. Relevant laws and guidance provide agencies flexibility in developing estimates. This report describes agencies' processes to estimate improper payments in selected programs for fiscal year 2017 and the extent to which certain differences in these processes can affect the usefulness of the resulting estimates. GAO selected 10 programs across six agencies with the largest reported program outlays in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. For these programs, GAO reviewed relevant laws and guidance, analyzed agencies' policies and procedures, and interviewed officials at relevant agencies and OMB staff. The six agencies GAO reviewed reported taking various approaches related to key components of estimating improper payments—shown in the figure below—for 10 selected programs, which collectively reported outlays of over $2.5 trillion for fiscal year 2017. Sample selection. Eight of the 10 programs GAO reviewed reported using statistically valid approaches, and the remaining 2 reported using alternative methodologies approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The sampled data elements varied, including payments, medical claims, and tax returns. The age of the data used to develop fiscal year 2017 improper payment estimates also varied, ranging from calendar year 2013 to fiscal year 2017. Identification of improper payments. Some of the six agencies reported using processes designed specifically to estimate improper payments, whereas others reported leveraging existing reviews. These agencies' policies and procedures include a review of aspects of eligibility, except for those related to the Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Pay and the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Retirement overpayments. DOD and OPM have not fully assessed whether their estimation processes effectively consider key program risks. OMB guidance does not specifically address how agencies are to test to identify improper payments, such as using a risk-based approach to help ensure that key risks of improper payments are addressed. The six agencies also varied in the treatment of insufficient documentation, both in identifying and in reporting the root causes of improper payments. For the agencies that contact entities outside the agency to estimate improper payments, the treatment of nonresponse differed, with one agency including nonresponses as improper payments and another generally excluding the nonresponse cases from review. Although OMB guidance states that agencies should treat cases of insufficient documentation as improper payments, it does not specifically address the treatment of nonresponse cases. Calculation of the improper payment estimate. The six agencies generally reported using law and OMB guidance to calculate improper payment estimates for the selected programs, except for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) removed overpayments that were recovered when developing its estimate. OMB guidance requires agencies to include recovered amounts in their estimates. Removing these overpayments understates the EITC improper payment estimate and may limit IRS's ability to develop corrective actions to prevent improper payments.

Below 100 millisieverts (mSv) or 10 rem, the dose-response relationship between cancer and radiation exposure is not definitively established. Federal agencies, including EPA, NRC, DOE, and FDA, have relied on scientific advisory bodies' recommendations, such as the International Commission on Radiological Protection, National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, and National Academies' Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board, to establish radiation protection requirements and guidance. The linear no-threshold model, which assumes that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure, is used. Federal regulations set dose limits for radiation exposure, such as NRC's annual dose limit for members of the public from nuclear power plants, which is a hundredth of the level the National Academies consider low dose. Agencies, including DOE and NIH, have funded research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, with DOE's Low Dose Radiation Research Program focusing on radiobiological research and NIH's studies on both epidemiological and radiobiological aspects. From fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016, funding for research on health effects of low-dose radiation decreased by 48%, primarily due to DOE's reduction in funding for its Low Dose Radiation Research Program. The report recommends that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to address overall research priorities related to low-dose radiation health effects. However, DOE did not agree with this recommendation.", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's September 2017 report, entitled Low-Dose Radiation: Interagency Collaboration on Planning Research Could Improve Information on Health Effects ( GAO-17-546 ). The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

The agency is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. The mission of the FCC is to make available for all people of the United States, \"without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\" The FCC operates under a public interest mandate first laid out in the 1927 Radio Act (P.L. 632, 69th Congress), but how this mandate is applied depends on how \"the public interest\" is interpreted. Some regulators seek to protect and benefit the public at large through regulation, while others seek to achieve the same goals through the promotion of market efficiency. Additionally, Congress granted the FCC wide latitude and flexibility to revise its interpretation of the public interest standard to reflect changing circumstances and the agency has not defined it in more concrete terms. These circumstances, paired with changes in FCC leadership, have led to significant changes over time in how the FCC regulates the broadcast and telecommunications industries. The FCC is directed by five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms. The President designates one of the commissioners as chairperson. Three commissioners may be members of the same political party of the President and none can have a financial interest in any commission-related business. The current commissioners are Ajit Pai (Chair), Michael O'Rielly, Brendan Carr, Jessica Rosenworcel, and Geoffrey Starks. The day-to-day functions of the FCC are carried out by 7 bureaus and 10 offices. The current basic structure of the FCC was established in 2002 as part of the agency's effort to better reflect the industries it regulates. The seventh bureau, the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, was established in 2006. The bureaus process applications for licenses and other filings, manage non-federal spectrum, analyze complaints, conduct investigations, develop and implement regulatory programs, and participate in hearings, among other things. The offices provide support services. Bureaus and offices often collaborate when addressing FCC issues. Beginning in the 110th Congress, the FCC has been funded through the House and Senate Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill as a single line item. Previously, it was funded through what is now the Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill, also as a single line item. Since 2009 the FCC's budget has been derived from regulatory fees collected by the agency rather than through a direct appropriation. The fees, often referred to as \"Section (9) fees,\" are collected from license holders and certain other entities. The FCC is authorized to review the regulatory fees each year and adjust them to reflect changes in its appropriation from year to year. Most years, appropriations language prohibits the use by the commission of any excess collections received in the current fiscal year or any prior years.

Disputes over the constitutionality or legality of the exercise of emergency powers are judicially reviewable. Both the judiciary and Congress, as co-equal branches, can restrain the executive regarding emergency powers. So can public opinion. Since 1976, the President has been subject to certain procedural formalities in utilizing some statutorily delegated emergency authority. The National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. §§1601-1651) eliminated or modified some statutory grants of emergency authority, required the President to formally declare the existence of a national emergency and to specify what statutory authority activated by the declaration would be used, and provided Congress a means to countermand the President's declaration and the activated authority being sought.

{"id": 27, "pred": "The report highlights the significant growth of USPS's competitive products sector from 750 million pieces in fiscal year 2008 to 4.9 billion pieces in fiscal year 2017, with revenue increasing from 10 percent to 28 percent during the same period. USPS attributes this growth to the rise of e-commerce and the increasing demand for \"last-mile\" delivery services. In fiscal year 2017, revenue from competitive products exceeded expectations by $500 million. However, USPS faces growing competition in the first- and last-mile delivery services from other providers.\n\nTo remain competitive, USPS uses real-time visibility and accurate delivery time estimates for its competitive products, which are generated from scanning data. The report notes that USPS's scanning performance is generally high, but some missed and inaccurate scans do occur, potentially affecting millions of competitive products.\n\nThe report recommends that the Postmaster General take three actions to improve USPS's competitive products scanning: (1) adopt a set of internal control standards, (2) improve the communication of standard operating procedures, and (3) create standard operating procedures for managers on how to address inaccurate scans and use available reports to investigate and resolve scanning issues.\n\nUSPS agreed with the recommendations regarding scanning procedures but could not agree to adopt a set of internal control standards at that time, as it was planning to conduct a cost study to determine the benefits and costs of doing so. The report concludes by noting that accurate tracking of competitive products is increasingly important for USPS's economic viability and that the adoption of internal control standards could enhance its efforts to continuously improve operational internal controls for scanning competitive products.", "answers": ["USPS's competitive products have become increasingly important, comprising about 28 percent of USPS's total revenue. USPS scans these packages at various points throughout the postal network. When scans are inaccurate or missing, questions are raised about the veracity of USPS's data on scanning performance and can lead to customer complaints. GAO was asked to review USPS's scanning policies and procedures. In this report, GAO (1) describes USPS's scanning performance and (2) examines how USPS ensures accurate scanning. GAO reviewed USPS's policies and procedures and assessed them against internal control standards; interviewed officials from USPS and five high-volume mailers; and conducted site visits to six post offices in two USPS districts that represented a range of volume, number of routes, and performance. Mail products over which the United States Postal Service (USPS) does not exercise market dominance, such as many of its packages, are called competitive products. These items are scanned throughout the mail delivery system to track their progress (see figure). USPS data show that these products are almost always scanned. For example, USPS data showed that for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2018; all but one of USPS's 67 districts met their scanning goals. Additionally, mailers that account for a high volume of USPS's competitive products told GAO that they believed USPS was generally scanning products correctly. However, a small percentage of missed or inaccurate scans occur. For example, a report from one USPS district showed that for one week, 0.73 percent of the products delivered were missing a scan and that for the fiscal year to date almost 155,000 competitive products were missing a delivery scan. USPS has designed and implemented procedures and activities to help ensure accurate scanning, but some limitations could contribute to scanning errors. For example, USPS has not based its operational procedures for scanning on any internal control standards. USPS officials said the procedures were based on USPS's unique responsibilities, management experience, and sound business practices, but the officials could not identify specific standards or a framework that they followed as the basis for the procedures. USPS officials said they did not believe any internal controls standards applied to these procedures. By not basing procedures on standards, USPS may miss opportunities to improve how it achieves its mission to scan and measure the performance of competitive products. Additionally, USPS's scanning procedure documents, such as for outlining specific delivery scanning steps, are not always consistent, and USPS relies on more informal methods, such as meetings with employees to communicate changes. Thus, employees may not have accurate procedures available to them. Finally, USPS lacks procedures to help managers identify and address incorrect scans, address customer complaints or otherwise address scanning irregularities. For example, USPS's guidance for managers is limited to a list of bullet-points that do not detail the steps managers should follow to resolve scanning irregularities. In addition, this list has not been updated since 2005. Without consistent or detailed procedures, USPS's employees and managers may not scan items accurately or find information needed to resolve scanning issues—a situation that could hinder USPS's ability to reduce inaccurate or missing scans for these important mail products. GAO recommends that USPS: (1) identify and adopt internal control standards for its operational activities such as for scanning of competitive products; (2) improve the communication of procedures for scanning competitive products; and, (3) create procedures for supervisors on how to address inaccurate scans and resolve scanning issues.

{"id": 28, "pred": "NASA's mission includes driving advances in science, technology, aeronautics, and space exploration, while contributing to education, innovation, and the stewardship of the Earth. The agency's major projects range from Earth-observing satellites to space telescopes and human transportation spacecraft. NASA's space flight projects undergo a two-phase life cycle: formulation and implementation. Formulation includes concept development and preliminary design, while implementation involves building, launching, and operating the system. Major projects require approval at key decision points and must develop a joint cost and schedule confidence level (JCL) if their life-cycle cost exceeds $250 million.\n\nThe report highlights three major space telescope projects: WFIRST, TESS, and JWST. WFIRST is in the early stages of development and is expected to cost between $3.2 billion and $3.8 billion. TESS, with an estimated cost of $337 million, is scheduled to launch in March 2018. JWST, the most complex and costly project, has a life-cycle cost estimate of $8.835 billion and is currently experiencing technical challenges that may lead to additional delays.\n\nHistorically, NASA projects have faced cost overruns and schedule delays due to management and oversight problems, including poor planning, optimistic cost estimating, funding gaps, lax oversight, and poor contractor performance. To address these issues, NASA has taken steps to enhance cost and schedule estimating, provide adequate reserves, establish better processes and metrics, and expand the use of earned value management.\n\nThe report emphasizes the importance of managing cost and schedule performance for large projects to limit implications for the entire portfolio. Cost and schedule reserves should be adequate, and project JCLs should be updated regularly to provide realistic estimates to decision-makers. Enhanced oversight of contractors can also improve project outcomes. NASA continues to make progress on its space telescope projects but must learn from past experiences to minimize cost overruns and schedule delays.", "answers": ["Acquisition management has been a long-standing challenge at NASA, although GAO has reported on improvements the agency has made in recent years. Three space telescope projects are the key enablers for NASA to achieve its astrophysics' science goals, which include seeking to understand the universe. In its fiscal year 2018 budget request, NASA asked for about $697 million for these three projects, which represents over 50 percent of NASA's budget for its astrophysics' major projects. In total, these projects represent an expected investment of at least $12.4 billion. This statement reflects preliminary observations on (1) the current status and cost of NASA's major telescope projects and (2) lessons learned that can be applied to NASA's management of its telescope projects. This statement is based on ongoing work on JWST and ongoing work on the status of NASA's major projects. Both reports are planned to be published in Spring 2018. This statement is also based on past GAO reports on JWST and NASA's acquisitions of major projects, and NASA input. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) current portfolio of major space telescopes includes three projects that vary in cost, complexity, and phase of the acquisition life cycle. GAO's ongoing work indicates that these projects are each making progress in line with their phase of the acquisition cycle but also face some challenges. For example, the current launch date for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project reflects a 57-60-month delay from the project's original schedule. GAO's preliminary observations indicate this project still has significant integration and testing to complete, with very little schedule reserve remaining to account for delays. Therefore, additional delays beyond the delay of up to 8 months recently announced are likely, and funding available under the $8 billion Congressional cost cap for formulation and development may be inadequate. There are a number of lessons learned from its acquisitions that NASA could consider to increase the likelihood of successful outcomes for its telescope projects, as well as for its larger portfolio of projects, such as its human spaceflight projects. For example, twice in the history of the JWST program, independent reviews found that the program was not holding adequate cost and schedule reserves. GAO has found that NASA has not applied this lesson learned to all of its large projects, and similar outcomes to JWST have started to emerge. For example, NASA did not incorporate this lesson with its human spaceflight programs. In July 2016 and April 2017, GAO found that these programs were holding inadequate levels of cost and schedule reserves to cover unexpected cost increases or delays. In April 2017, GAO recommended that NASA reassess the date of the programs' first test flight. NASA concurred and, in November 2017, announced a launch delay of up to 19 months.

GAO was asked to review U.S. assistance to these four organizations. In this report, GAO (1) assesses the extent to which the organizations' strategic goals align with those of U.S. agencies; (2) examines how the organizations oversee the use of their funds and the extent to which U.S. agencies have supported those efforts; (3) assesses the extent to which U.S. agencies included key monitoring provisions as part of assistance agreements; and (4) assesses the extent to which U.S. agencies had documentation of monitoring activities, including those called for by these provisions. GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from State, USAID, HHS, USDA, and the organizations. GAO also analyzed a nongeneralizable sample of 12 of the 60 assistance agreements that were awarded by State, USAID, HHS, and USDA to OAS, PAHO, and IICA and were active during calendar years 2014 through 2016. For each agency, GAO selected three agreements with the lowest, median, and highest dollar value. GAO found that strategic goals of the Organization of American States (OAS), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH) are predominantly aligned with the strategic goals of the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). For example, IICA's strategic goals of a productive agricultural sector, enhancing agricultural development, and food security are aligned with USDA's foreign assistance goals. State, USAID, HHS, and USDA fund activities in the form of assistance agreements (e.g., grants and cooperative agreements) with OAS, PAHO, and IICA, which in 2016 totaled $32 million. According to agency officials, the agencies employ mechanisms to ensure that these agreements align with U.S. strategic goals. OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH have established mechanisms for overseeing their use of funds, such as external auditors, internal audit boards, and anti-fraud and ethics policies. State and USDA have directly supported these mechanisms. For example, State engaged in the selection process for OAS's Inspector General. GAO's review of 12 selected assistance agreements found that USDA included no financial or performance monitoring provisions in one of its agreements and that State did not include two key monitoring provisions in one of its agreements, called for by applicable guidance. GAO found that the remaining 10 agreements it reviewed contained all key monitoring provisions and that State has since taken corrective action. GAO found that U.S. agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the 42 monitoring activities required by the 12 assistance agreements GAO reviewed (see table). For example, USDA did not have full documentation, such as for financial reports, of any of its 10 required monitoring activities and USDA officials did not explain their lack of documentation. USAID officials explained that their lack of full documentation was due, in part, to grant officers not always following their document management policies. State and HHS have since taken corrective action. If an agency does not have full documentation of monitoring activities, it may lack information needed to make appropriate budgetary and programmatic decisions. GAO recommends that (1) USDA ensure inclusion of all monitoring provisions as part of agreements and (2) USAID and USDA ensure full documentation of monitoring activities.

{"id": 30, "pred": "The report by the government agency highlights the shift in the sale of counterfeit goods from underground markets to primary markets, including e-commerce websites, corporate and government supply chains, and traditional retail stores. Counterfeiters are now trying to deceive consumers into purchasing fake goods by exploiting third-party online marketplaces, posting pictures of authentic goods, and posting pseudonymous reviews. The volume, variety, and methods of shipment of counterfeit goods have also changed, with express carriers and international mail becoming the predominant form of transportation. The report recommends that consumers buy only from authorized retailers online, avoid prices that seem too good to be true, and report counterfeit products. The report identifies challenges for CBP and ICE in distinguishing between legitimate and counterfeit goods, the expanding range of counterfeit goods, and the difficulty of tracking counterfeiters through various website fulfillment and delivery mechanisms. The report also recommends that CBP, in consultation with ICE, assess what additional information could be shared with the private sector to enhance information sharing and protect intellectual property rights.", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's January 2018 report, entitled Intellectual Property: Agencies Can Improve Efforts to Address Risks Posed by Changing Counterfeits Market , ( GAO-18-216 ). Changes in the market for counterfeit goods entering the United States pose new challenges for consumers, the private sector, and U.S. agencies that enforce intellectual property rights (IPR). Specifically, growth in e-commerce has contributed to a shift in the sale of counterfeit goods in the United States, with consumers increasingly purchasing goods online and counterfeiters producing a wider variety of goods that may be sold on websites alongside authentic products. For example, 20 of 47 items GAO purchased from third-party sellers on popular consumer websites were counterfeit, according to testing by the products' rights holders (see table), highlighting potential risks to consumers. The changes in the market for counterfeit goods can also pose challenges to the private sector—for example, the challenge of distinguishing counterfeit from authentic goods listed for sale online—and complicate the enforcement efforts of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). CBP and ICE engage in a number of activities to enhance IPR enforcement; however, while ICE has assessed some of its efforts, CBP has taken limited steps to do so. CBP's and ICE's IPR enforcement activities broadly include detecting imports of potentially IPR-infringing goods, conducting special operations at U.S. ports, engaging with international partners, and undertaking localized pilot programs or port-led initiatives. CBP and ICE have collected some performance data for each of the eight activities GAO reviewed, and ICE has taken some steps to understand the impact of its efforts. However, CBP has conducted limited evaluation of its efforts to enhance IPR enforcement. Consequently, CBP may lack information needed to ensure it is investing its resources in the most efficient and effective activities. CBP and ICE generally collaborate on IPR enforcement, but according to private sector representatives, restrictions on CBP's information sharing limit private sector enforcement efforts. GAO found that CBP and ICE have undertaken efforts that align with selected key practices for interagency collaboration, such as participating in developing a national IPR enforcement strategy and agreeing on roles and responsibilities. However, sharing additional information about seized items with rights-holding companies and e-commerce websites could improve enforcement, according to private sector representatives.

{"id": 31, "pred": "This report answers common questions about the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant. It includes state-level data in Appendix B. The report does not discuss TANF program rules (see CRS Report RL32748). The TANF program is funded through a combination of federal and state funds. In FY2018, the federal grant totaled $16.5 billion, with a contingency fund available. States are required to spend a minimum amount of their own funds. In real terms, the value of the block grant has declined by one-third since FY1997. The TANF program was established in 1996 and is primarily used for cash benefits to meet basic needs, child care, work-related activities, and other social services. In FY2017, $31.1 billion of both federal TANF and state Maintenance of Effort (MOE) funds were spent or transferred to other programs. In real terms, the FY2018 block grant was 36% below its value in FY1997. The report also discusses work requirements and penalties for states that do not meet the TANF work participation standards. In FY2017, two jurisdictions (Nevada and Guam) did not meet the all-family participation standard. TANF also has a second standard for the two-parent portion of its cash assistance caseload, which can also be lowered by caseload reduction. Of the 28 jurisdictions with two-parent families in their FY2017 TANF work participation calculation, 19 met the standard and 9 did not.", "answers": ["The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant funds a wide range of benefits and services for low-income families with children. TANF was created in the 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193). This report responds to some frequently asked questions about TANF; it does not describe TANF rules (see, instead, CRS Report RL32748, The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant: A Primer on TANF Financing and Federal Requirements, by Gene Falk). TANF Funding and Expenditures. TANF provides fixed funding for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territories, and American Indian tribes. The basic block grant totals $16.5 billion per year. States are also required in total to contribute, from their own funds, at least $10.3 billion annually under a maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement. Though TANF is best known for funding cash assistance payments for needy families with children, the block grant and MOE funds are used for a wide variety of benefits and activities. In FY2017, expenditures on basic assistance totaled $7.1 billion—23% of total federal TANF and MOE dollars. Basic assistance is often—but not exclusively—paid as cash. In addition to funding basic assistance, TANF also contributes funds for child care and services for children who have been, or are at risk of being, abused and neglected. Some states also count expenditures in prekindergarten programs toward the MOE requirement. The TANF Assistance Caseload. A total of 1.2 million families, composed of 3.1 million recipients, received TANF- or MOE-funded assistance in September 2018. The bulk of the \"recipients\" were children—2.3 million in that month. The assistance caseload is heterogeneous. The type of family once thought of as the \"typical\" assistance family—one with an unemployed adult recipient—accounted for 32% of all families on the rolls in FY2016. Additionally, 31% of cash assistance families had an employed adult, while 38% of all TANF families were \"child-only\" and had no adult recipient. Child-only families include those with disabled adults receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), adults who are nonparents (e.g., grandparents, aunts, uncles) caring for children, and families consisting of citizen children and ineligible noncitizen parents. Cash Assistance Benefits. TANF cash benefit amounts are set by states. In July 2017, the maximum monthly benefit for a family of three ranged from $1,021 in New Hampshire to $170 in Mississippi. Only New Hampshire (at 60% of the federal poverty guidelines) had a maximum TANF cash assistance amount for this sized family in excess of 50% of poverty-level income. Work Requirements. TANF's main federal work requirement is actually a performance measure that applies to the states. States determine the work rules that apply to individual recipients. TANF law requires states to engage 50% of all families and 90% of two-parent families with work-eligible individuals in work activities, though these standards can be reduced by \"credits.\" Therefore, the effective standards states face are often less than the 50% or 90% targets, and vary by state. In FY2017, states achieved, on average, an all-family participation rate of 53.0% and a two-parent rate of 69.5%. In FY2017, two jurisdictions did not meet the all-family participation standard: Nevada and Guam. This is a reduction from FY2012, when 16 states did not meet that standard. In FY2017, nine jurisdictions did not meet the two-parent standard.

The competitive service is the largest category, consisting of over two million employees in the executive branch and other areas. Applicants for these positions undergo competitive examinations, and hiring and removal standards are prescribed by law. The excepted service includes positions not in the competitive service or SES, often exempted due to their nature or recruitment needs. The SES is a cadre of high-level government administrators, with different hiring and removal standards and a separate pay structure. The report highlights the central features and differences among these classifications, including the application process, pay scales, and notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions. Approximately one-third of federal workers are in the excepted service, and their notice and appeal rights vary depending on their employment status. The SES consists of over 7,000 permanent positions, with career reserved and general designations, and different types of appointments. The report also discusses the unique removal procedures for SES members employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs.", "answers": ["According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal workforce consists of an estimated two million civilian employees. Federal law categorizes these employees into three types of service—the competitive service, the excepted service, and the Senior Executive Service (SES)—that may be distinguished by different selection, compensation, and other standards. Title 5 of the U.S. Code (Title 5) contains most of the standards governing federal employment, and OPM is generally responsible for implementing these requirements. The competitive service largely consists of all civil service positions in the executive branch, other than (1) positions excepted from the competitive service by statute; (2) positions appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate; and (3) the SES. Traditionally, OPM has administered examinations for entrance into the competitive service. These examinations are meant to be \"practical in character\" and relate to \"matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the applicants for the appointment sought.\" Title 5 also authorizes OPM to prescribe rules allowing agencies to hire candidates directly under specified circumstances. The excepted service includes designated civil service positions that are not in the competitive service or the SES and are not subject to competitive examination. OPM maintains authority to exempt a position from the competitive service when it determines that an appointment through competitive examination is not practicable, or the recruitment of students or recent graduates would be better achieved through alternate recruitment and assessment processes. The pay structure for the competitive service and the excepted service is similar. Both services are typically paid in accordance with the General Schedule, a schedule of annual basic pay rates that consists of 15 grades, designated \"GS-1\" through \"GS-15.\" This fixed pay scale is generally designed to reflect, among other things, equal pay for substantially equal work within a local pay area. Additionally, the competitive service and the excepted service generally have similar notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions. For example, before a removal, a suspension for more than 14 days, a reduction in grade or pay, or a furlough of 30 days or less, the agency must provide at least 30 days' advance written notice to the affected employee. The employee must also be given a reasonable time to respond to the notice and provide affidavits and other evidence to support the answer. Some adverse actions may also be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board), an independent, quasi-judicial agency that reviews and adjudicates specified personnel actions taken against qualifying federal employees. The SES is a corps of some 7,000 high-level government administrators who manage major programs and projects within most federal agencies. In these leadership roles, SES members may serve as a link between top-level political appointees of an agency and career civil servants within the agency. The SES is governed by a regulatory structure separate from the competitive and excepted services. While SES members are primarily career appointees chosen through a merit-based competitive hiring process, others are noncareer, limited term or limited emergency appointees (commonly political appointees) selected by agency leadership. To shield certain SES roles from political influence, some SES positions (career reserved positions) must be filled with career appointees, and Title 5 limits the number of noncareer and limited term appointees that may serve in SES positions. The SES pay structure is distinct from the rest of the civil service. Title 5 specifies that SES members are paid within a particular range based on an executive's individual performance or contribution to agency performance (or both), as measured under a performance appraisal system. In addition, Title 5 articulates special conditions and procedures for removing, suspending, or taking other adverse actions against a member of the SES. For example, career SES appointees who have successfully completed a one-year probationary period may be removed or subject to adverse action only for specified reasons, including misconduct and substandard performance. Career appointees must receive advance written notice of these actions, and an opportunity to appeal the action. In comparison, noncareer, limited term, and limited emergency appointees are generally not subject to the same protections and may be removed from the SES at any time."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2697, "token_length": 4168, "chunk_ppl": [16.873308181762695, 5.904262065887451, 6.007203578948975, 8.087512969970703, 5.518560409545898, 4.651379585266113, 7.193225383758545, 6.4691481590271, 3.482891798019409, 4.638339519500732, 4.792031288146973, 3.4343996047973633, 6.887960433959961, 2.621734857559204, 5.171511650085449, 5.381524085998535, 7.570703506469727, 8.99294376373291, 6.367753982543945, 3.824749708175659, 4.438372611999512, 9.566965103149414, 4.332054615020752, 6.625495433807373, 6.406828880310059, 5.690423488616943, 5.596650123596191, 4.234619617462158, 18.076831817626953], "total_ppl": 5.813035488128662, "block_sizes": [12, 17, 8, 22, 14, 8, 11, 20, 24, 21, 10, 16, 9, 14, 16, 32, 9, 10, 17, 11, 19, 10, 14, 19, 10, 11, 12, 25, 14, 9, 32, 13, 17, 15, 32, 22, 10, 9, 26, 8, 9, 18, 14, 14, 9, 22, 9, 8, 11, 9, 11, 15, 22, 10, 15, 11, 8, 11, 32, 13, 8, 10, 10, 32, 18, 32, 10, 29, 17, 10, 8, 10, 14, 13, 18, 26, 11, 13, 32, 26, 24, 19, 26, 11, 31, 15, 11, 14, 19, 12, 15, 32, 17, 11, 13, 8, 9, 12, 9, 13, 16, 8, 32, 9, 15, 12, 17, 23, 21, 20, 10, 12, 11, 11, 13, 12, 8, 10, 9, 28, 14, 21, 18, 16, 8, 9, 8, 8, 9, 15, 10, 9, 10, 11, 8, 14, 9, 9, 8, 21, 14, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8, 15, 9, 12, 11, 12, 13, 17, 19, 10, 10, 10, 11, 11, 11, 13, 18, 15, 11, 9, 26, 24, 10, 26, 14, 13, 17, 32, 15, 11, 32, 10, 8, 14, 13, 11, 14, 20, 14, 8, 17, 14, 22, 8, 9, 8, 12], "mean_block_size": 14.651041666666666, "generation_time": 320.2401747703552}
{"id": 34, "pred": "The report by the government agency discusses the use of hosted payloads, which are instruments or packages of equipment integrated onto a host satellite, making use of the host satellite's resources. Commercially hosted DOD payloads refer to DOD payloads on commercial satellites. Hosted payloads can be experimental or operational, with civil government agencies like NASA and NOAA being early adopters. Benefits of using commercially hosted payloads include cost savings, faster on-orbit capability, increased deterrence and resilience, and the ability to incorporate new technologies. However, challenges include matching size, weight, power, and spectrum requirements between the payload and host satellite, and addressing concerns over payload control and cybersecurity. The report recommends that the Secretary of Defense require programs using hosted payloads to provide cost and technical data, and lessons learned to a central office to help mitigate logistical challenges and make informed decisions on the use of hosted payloads. The report also mentions that civil and other government agencies use commercially hosted payloads for various purposes, including navigation systems, environmental monitoring, scientific missions, and search and rescue systems, citing cost savings and the ability to leverage existing commercial schedules and technologies as reasons for their use.", "answers": ["Each year, DOD spends billions of dollars to develop, produce, and field large, complex satellites. For such satellite systems, a single adversary attack or on-orbit failure can result in the loss of billions of dollars of investment and significant loss of vital capabilities. As DOD plans new space systems and addresses an increasingly contested space environment, it has the opportunity to consider different acquisition approaches. One such approach is to integrate a government sensor or payload onto a commercial host satellite. House Armed Services Committee report 115-200, accompanying a bill for the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, included a provision for GAO to review DOD's use of commercially hosted payloads. This report (1) determines the extent to which DOD uses commercially hosted payloads and (2) describes and assesses factors that affect their use. GAO reviewed DOD policies, documentation, and planning documents, and interviewed a wide range of DOD and civil government officials, and commercial stakeholders. GAO and others have found that using commercial satellites to host government sensors or communications packages—called payloads—may be one way DOD can achieve on-orbit capability faster and more affordably. Using hosted payloads may also help facilitate a proliferation of payloads on orbit, making it more difficult for an adversary to defeat a capability. Since 2009, DOD has used three commercially hosted payloads, with three more missions planned or underway through 2022 (see figure below). DOD estimates that it has achieved cost savings of several hundred million dollars from using commercially hosted payloads to date, and expects to realize additional savings and deliver faster capabilities on orbit from planned missions. Cost savings can result from sharing development, launch, and ground system costs with the commercial host company. Among the factors that affect DOD's use of hosted payloads are a perception among some DOD officials that matching government payloads to commercial satellites is too difficult; and limited, fragmented knowledge on how to mitigate various challenges GAO found that further opportunities to use hosted payloads may emerge as DOD plans new and follow-on space systems in the coming years. However, DOD's knowledge on using hosted payloads is fragmented, in part because programs are not required to share information. In 2011, the Air Force created a Hosted Payload Office to provide expertise and other tools to facilitate matching government payloads with commercial hosts. However, GAO found that DOD programs using hosted payloads are not required and generally do not provide cost and technical data, or lessons learned, to the Hosted Payload Office, or another central office for analysis. Requiring programs that use hosted payloads agency-wide to provide this information to a central location would better position DOD to make informed decisions when considering acquisition approaches for upcoming space system designs. GAO recommends that DOD require programs using commercially hosted payloads to contribute resulting data to a central location. In implementing this recommendation, DOD should assess whether the Air Force's Hosted Payload Office is the appropriate location to collect and analyze the data.

{"id": 35, "pred": "The Social Security Administration (SSA) manages three programs: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, Disability Insurance, and Supplemental Security Income. In fiscal year 2019, SSA is estimated to pay out $1.1 trillion in benefits to over 64 million people. The agency heavily relies on IT systems to process transactions, maintain records, and evaluate eligibility. However, SSA's IT management has faced challenges, including weaknesses in system development practices, governance, and strategic planning.\n\nIn response, SSA requested $132 million in its fiscal year 2019 budget to modernize its IT environment, including updating database designs, eliminating outdated code, and upgrading infrastructure.

The agency has also taken steps to improve IT acquisitions and operations by addressing 14 of the 15 recommendations GAO made from 2011 to 2018. However, fully addressing the role and responsibilities of the CIO in all six key management areas is essential for SSA to effectively manage its IT and address longstanding challenges.", "answers": ["SSA delivers services that touch the lives of almost every American, and relies heavily on IT resources to do so. Its systems support a range of activities, such as processing Disability Insurance payments, to calculating and withholding Medicare premiums, and issuing Social Security numbers and cards. For fiscal year 2018, the agency planned to spend approximately $1.6 billion on IT. GAO has previously reported that federal IT projects have often failed, in part, due to a lack of oversight and governance. Given the challenges that federal agencies, including SSA, have encountered in managing IT acquisitions, Congress and the administration have taken steps to improve federal IT, including enacting federal IT acquisition reform legislation and issuing related guidance. This statement summarizes GAO's previously reported findings regarding SSA's management of IT acquisitions and operations. In developing this testimony, GAO summarized findings from its reports issued in 2011 through 2018, and information on SSA's actions in response to GAO's recommendations. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has improved its management of information technology (IT) acquisitions and operations by addressing 14 of the 15 recommendations that GAO has made to the agency. For example, Incremental development . The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has emphasized the need for agencies to deliver IT investments in smaller increments to reduce risk and deliver capabilities more quickly. In November 2017, GAO reported that agencies, including SSA, needed to improve their certification of incremental development. As a result, GAO recommended that SSA's CIO (1) report incremental development information accurately, and (2) update its incremental development policy and processes. SSA implemented both recommendations. Software licenses . Effective management of software licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In May 2014, GAO reported that most agencies, including SSA, lacked comprehensive software license policies. As a result, GAO made six recommendations to SSA, to include developing a comprehensive software licenses policy and inventory. SSA implemented all six recommendations. However, SSA's IT management policies have not fully addressed the role of its CIO. Various laws and related guidance assign IT management responsibilities to CIOs in six key areas. In August 2018, GAO reported that SSA had fully addressed the role of the CIO in one of the six areas (see table). Specifically, SSA's policies fully addressed the CIO's role in the IT leadership and accountability area by requiring the CIO to report directly to the agency head, among other things. In contrast, SSA's policies did not address or minimally addressed the IT workforce and IT strategic planning areas. For example, SSA's policies did not include requirements for the CIO to annually assess the extent to which personnel meet IT management skill requirements or to measure how well IT supports agency programs. GAO recommended that SSA address the weaknesses in the remaining five key areas.

{"id": 36, "pred": "The report discusses the use of user fees and charges by the federal government as an alternative to taxes for raising public funds. User fees are voluntary payments made in exchange for specific services or benefits provided by the government. These fees accounted for approximately $331 billion in FY2017, or about a tenth of total federal receipts. Some fees are tied to regulatory or judicial activities, while others are intragovernmental transactions. Agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Patent and Trademark Office, and Federal Trade Commission are largely funded by user fees and other nontax receipts. User fees have advantages as a means of financing public activities, including their voluntary nature, connection between financing and benefits, and potential for decentralizing decision-making. However, they may not be compulsory, and not paying them may make it impossible to carry out certain activities legally. The report also notes that the economic burden of user fees may be less politically resistant than broad-based taxes. The report suggests that Congress could enhance its oversight of agencies reliant on user fees by requiring more timely and detailed financial reports and clearer explanations of the linkages between fees and associated programs. The report also discusses the potential for privatizing government services and the challenges of designing fees that directly address negative spillovers. Overall, the report highlights the importance of user fees as a means of financing public activities and the need for effective financial management and oversight of these fees.", "answers": ["The federal government collects various fees from businesses and households. Choosing to raise public funds via user fees, as opposed to other means such as taxes, has important administrative and economic consequences. Many fees stem from \"business-like activities,\" in which the government provides a service or benefit in return for payment. For example, many national parks charge entry fees, which then help fund maintenance projects. Such fees and charges that result from voluntary choices, such as entering a national park, are distinguished from taxes—which stem from the government's sovereign power to compel payments. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) defines a user fee as a \"fee assessed to users for goods or services provided by the federal government. User fees generally apply to federal programs or activities that provide special benefits to identifiable recipients above and beyond what is normally available to the public.\" User fees and charges have several advantages as a means of financing public activities. They are voluntary, they connect the burden of financing activities to those who directly benefit from them, and can help decentralize decisionmaking by bypassing centralized allocation of resources. Some have expressed concerns that user fee arrangements may bypass regular congressional scrutiny and dilute Congress's power of the purse. Collections of fees and charges may also be more sensitive to economic fluctuations, which could complicate financing of programs dependent on those revenue streams. Many user fees or charges are classified as offsetting collections, which are deposited into expenditure accounts. Offsetting collections can be used to offset agency spending and typically require no further congressional approval to use. Other fees and charges are classified as offsetting receipts, which are collected into revenue accounts and typically require congressional authorization to be spent. User fees and charges can be classified as discretionary or mandatory spending, depending on how they are legally authorized. The levels and administration of some fees are specified in detailed statutory text, while other fees are created under broader agency authorities. Certain agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have increased their reliance on user fees in past decades. Some critics have raised concerns that increased reliance on user fees could shift incentives facing those agencies. Some legislative proposals, such as H.R. 850 introduced in the 115th Congress, would limit or eliminate most exceptions and require most fees and charges to be deposited in the U.S. Treasury General Fund. Congress could fund agencies and activities now funded in whole or in part via user fees directly through the annual appropriations process. Such proposals would mark a departure from past practice. Statutory text governing many fees has evolved over many years and involves substantive policy decisions, often related to the industry or programmatic concerns. A general change in funding from user fees and charges to annual appropriations would likely shift the division of responsibilities between authorizing committees and appropriations committees. Congress may also enhance its oversight of agencies reliant on user fees by requiring more timely and detailed financial reports as well as more precise and systematic explanations of linkages between those fees and associated programs. Congress could also ask for greater transparency in fiscal data. While the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Treasury Bureau of the Fiscal Service provide extensive data on user fees and charges, it is difficult to conduct governmentwide analyses using publicly available sources. Congress could mandate more detailed and more easily accessed data on user fees and charges. Additional funding may be needed to develop the capacity to issue those data."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4022, "token_length": 5903, "chunk_ppl": [27.65926742553711, 6.213165760040283, 7.833896160125732, 8.169736862182617, 10.41606616973877, 8.214788436889648, 15.865464210510254, 10.424453735351562, 12.23408317565918, 4.326228618621826, 9.647601127624512, 10.47047233581543, 12.993621826171875, 9.930429458618164, 13.380684852600098, 7.425756454467773, 11.990370750427246, 10.610292434692383, 7.193083763122559, 13.017885208129883, 11.396219253540039, 7.94534158706665, 10.141223907470703, 8.120305061340332, 7.825372695922852, 14.409791946411133, 6.425138473510742, 9.832504272460938, 12.221211433410645, 16.24350357055664, 12.123287200927734, 9.996872901916504, 7.95595121383667, 12.737445831298828, 7.065966606140137, 8.61704158782959, 8.344260215759277, 11.50533676147461, 10.91351318359375, 10.161578178405762, 12.95988941192627, 12.800628662109375, 148.79530334472656], "total_ppl": 10.207877159118652, "block_sizes": [8, 26, 9, 28, 12, 32, 13, 12, 8, 27, 21, 19, 9, 32, 22, 8, 13, 9, 8, 11, 13, 8, 11, 25, 11, 14, 29, 18, 9, 9, 13, 12, 24, 9, 8, 10, 8, 26, 13, 29, 8, 9, 14, 8, 13, 15, 8, 21, 28, 11, 16, 10, 8, 16, 12, 8, 11, 13, 11, 17, 8, 8, 19, 24, 9, 18, 8, 18, 20, 9, 9, 9, 25, 8, 12, 29, 15, 12, 8, 9, 17, 8, 32, 12, 10, 14, 8, 10, 14, 10, 10, 19, 21, 22, 11, 8, 13, 8, 12, 11, 12, 17, 8, 10, 12, 15, 11, 10, 9, 13, 10, 8, 8, 26, 8, 11, 32, 10, 18, 11, 15, 10, 14, 8, 8, 8, 9, 14, 13, 13, 11, 14, 8, 9, 8, 15, 12, 16, 24, 32, 16, 14, 10, 13, 11, 9, 28, 9, 9, 10, 13, 8, 8, 10, 10, 11, 12, 12, 12, 8, 9, 14, 19, 11, 8, 14, 10, 12, 14, 25, 32, 8, 8, 9, 8, 10, 10, 13, 9, 30, 11, 8, 14, 15, 16, 15, 17, 14, 11, 17, 9, 8, 19, 16, 8, 12, 11, 29, 14, 10, 15, 21, 8, 8, 13, 23, 17, 9, 13, 9, 8, 10, 12, 20, 9, 11, 16, 12, 15, 8, 23, 15, 15, 16, 8, 8, 10, 23, 18, 23, 9, 8, 14, 12, 11, 9, 11, 12, 18, 11, 19, 13, 22, 32, 13, 9, 8, 12, 11, 20, 9, 17, 9, 9, 8, 12, 10, 8, 11, 13, 10, 18, 13, 12, 12, 8, 17, 14, 11, 14, 8, 9, 13, 8, 9, 8, 8, 18, 9, 10, 22, 17, 12, 13, 8, 13, 9, 10, 12, 24, 16, 18, 8, 16, 8, 8, 9, 17, 20, 8, 13, 11, 23, 9, 10, 32, 13, 10, 12, 19, 11, 16, 17, 9, 12, 18, 8, 17, 16, 16, 18, 13, 9, 11, 11, 18, 11, 10, 9, 32, 17, 13, 10, 10, 15, 8, 31, 8, 18, 13, 9, 9], "mean_block_size": 13.502923976608187, "generation_time": 439.56249594688416}
{"id": 37, "pred": "The report discusses the constitutional role of both the President and Congress in managing military bases in the U.S. While the President, as commander-in-chief, has historically held broad authority to open, close, or realign military installations, Congress has the responsibility to fund and legislate policy for military infrastructure through annual authorization and appropriation bills. In the 1970s, in response to large-scale closures of World War II era infrastructure, Congress passed the Military Construction Authorization Act of 1978, which established a report-and-wait process for major base closures or realignments. This legislation significantly limited the President's ability to close or realign domestic bases of significant size. Since then, Congress has periodically authorized Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) rounds to insulate base closings from political interference and to more effectively manage excess infrastructure. The most recent BRAC round, which took place from 2005 to 2011, saved the Department of Defense an estimated $12 billion annually. However, the report notes that the reliability of cost savings estimates has been questioned due to inconsistent recordkeeping and data management challenges. The Department of Defense has requested a new BRAC round to dispose of excess infrastructure and manage remaining real property assets more effectively. The report also mentions ongoing efforts to improve the accuracy of data related to BRAC and to find common ground with Congress on potential reforms. The authority for the Secretary of Defense to carry out a realignment or closure of a military installation under the BRAC process will terminate at the end of fiscal year 2029.", "answers": ["Since 1977, statutory thresholds have effectively constrained the President's ability to close or realign major military installations in the United States. Congress has instead periodically granted temporary authorities—known as a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)—that have established independent commissions for the review and approval of basing changes submitted by the Secretary of Defense. These unique and transient authorities last expired on April 16, 2006. There have been five rounds of base closures: 1988, 1991, 1993, 1995, and 2005. Though Congress has periodically adjusted the BRAC process to account for lessons learned, the modern framework has remained generally consistent with earlier rounds, and includes establishment of an independent commission; reliance on objective and uniform criteria; Government Accountability Office (GAO) review and certification of Department of Defense (DOD) data; deliberations designed to be transparent that include open hearings, solicitation of feedback, installation visits, and data available for public review; and requirement that the final list of closure and realignment recommendations be accepted or rejected in their entirety. Congress has defined BRAC selection criteria in statute, thus requiring the Secretary to prioritize military value over cost savings. Additionally, Congress has required the Secretary to align the Department's recommendations with a comprehensive 20-year force structure plan. The commission may modify, reject, or add recommendations during its review before forwarding a final list to the President. After receiving the Commission's list of recommendations, the President may either accept the report in its entirety or seek to modify it by indicating disapproval and returning it to the commission for further evaluation. If the President accepts the commission's recommendations, they are forwarded to Congress. BRAC implementation begins by default unless Congress rejects the recommendations in their entirety within 45 days by enacting a joint resolution. During the implementation phase, DOD is required to initiate closures and realignments within two years and complete all actions within six years. The BRAC process represents a legislative compromise between the executive and legislative branches wherein each shares power in managing the closure and realignment of military bases. The imposition of an independent, third-party mediator was intended to insulate base closings from political considerations by both branches that had complicated similar actions in the past.

{"id": 38, "pred": "The report discusses the historical development of the Holman rule in the House of Representatives, which establishes the separation of policy authorization from funding appropriations. The rule, which can be traced back to 1835, prohibits provisions changing existing law from being included in appropriations bills except for retrenchments that reduce expenditures. The report details how the rule has been interpreted and applied over time, with precedents tending to narrow its application. The report also discusses how the Holman rule was temporarily reinstated in a more expansive form during the 115th Congress, allowing for retrenchments related to the reduction of the number and salary of federal officers or compensation of persons paid out of the Treasury. However, the rule still requires germaneness and would not allow for broad legislative provisions or amendments that apply to the salary or number of federal employees funded through appropriations in other measures. The report concludes by emphasizing the importance of consulting the House Parliamentarian for formal opinions on parliamentary questions related to the chamber's rules and precedents.", "answers": ["Although congressional rules establish a general division of responsibility under which questions of policy are kept separate from questions of funding, House rules provide for exceptions in certain circumstances. One such circumstance allows for the inclusion of legislative language in general appropriations bills or amendments thereto for \"germane provisions that retrench expenditures by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill.\" This exception appears in clause 2(b) of House Rule XXI and is known as the Holman rule, after Representative William Holman of Indiana, who first proposed the exception in 1876. Since the period immediately after its initial adoption, the House has interpreted the Holman rule through precedents that have tended to incrementally narrow its application. Under current precedents, for a legislative provision or amendment to be in order, the legislative language in question must be both germane to other provisions in the measure and must produce a clear reduction of appropriations in that bill. In addition, the House adopted a separate order during the 115th Congress that provided for retrenchments of expenditures by a reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill to be construed as applying to: any provision or amendment that retrenches expenditures by— (1) the reduction of amounts of money in the bill; (2) the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States; or (3) the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States. This separate order was not readopted for the 116th Congress.

This represents a 0.2% decrease from FY2018 appropriations. For FY2019, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, included $484.0 million in direct appropriations for ITA (a 0.4% increase from the FY2018 appropriation), $95.0 million in funding for USITC (a 1.4% increase), and a total of $68.0 million for USTR (a 0.2% decrease). The Administration's Request On February 12, 2018, the Trump Administration submitted its FY2019 budget request to Congress. The FY2019 proposal included a total of $590.8 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies, an 8.9% decrease from FY2018 total appropriated amounts for these agencies. The Administration requested reducing funding for all three trade-related agencies.

Congressional Actions In the spring of 2018, the House and Senate reported FY2019 CJS appropriations bills, which included proposed funding for ITA, USITC, and USTR. The reported bills did not adopt many of the Administration's budget reductions, and instead proposed funding levels that were more similar to the FY2018-enacted amounts. The House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 5952 on May 17, 2018. The House proposal recommended a total of $647.6 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies. This proposal was $56.8 million more (9.6%) than the Administration's request, and $0.7 million less (-0.1%) than the FY2018-enacted legislation. The House committee proposed $480.0 million in direct funding for ITA, $95.0 million for USTIC, and a total of $72.6 million for USTR, comprised of $57.6 million for salaries and expenses and an additional $15.0 million from the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund for trade enforcement activities as authorized by the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-125). The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 3072 on June 14, 2018. The Senate committee-reported proposal recommended a total of $655.6 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies.

{"id": 40, "pred": "The U.S. Marine Corps report from October 1, 1986, outlines the organization, training, and equipment required for amphibious and land operations. The Marines were to have the necessary equipment to conduct amphibious operations and land campaigns, including the Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV) and Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV). In 2011, the Marines cancelled the EFV program due to excessive cost growth and poor performance in operational testing. The Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) and Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) were intended to replace the AAV and EFV, respectively. However, budgetary pressures led the Marines to put the MPC program \"on ice\" in 2013.\n\nThe report highlights the need for a wheeled armored fighting vehicle to transport Marines inland and the importance of the MPC for enhanced armor protection. The Marines are exploring ways to create temporary \"bubbles\" for Marines to get ashore in response to growing threats from advanced air and shore defense systems.\n\nIn March 2014, the Marines \"resurrected\" the MPC program and consolidated it with the ACV program to enable continuous production of ACVs. The Marines plan to acquire about 700 vehicles in total, with an expected cost of $1.2 billion. The report also discusses potential programmatic changes and ramifications of the consolidation, including cost savings, timeline for AAV replacement, and implications for the ACV 2.0 program.\n\nThe report concludes by noting that the Marines and Navy are studying the requirement to conduct large-scale amphibious operations in response to evolving threats and the need to maintain a strong amphibious assault capability. The report also mentions the potential impact of Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO) on the ACV program, including possible changes to the vehicles themselves and procurement quantities.", "answers": ["On January 6, 2011, after spending approximately $3 billion in developmental funding, the Marine Corps cancelled the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program due to poor reliability demonstrated during operational testing and excessive cost growth. Because the EFV was intended to replace the 40-year-old Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV), the Pentagon pledged to move quickly to develop a \"more affordable and sustainable\" vehicle to replace the EFV. The Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) is intended to replace the AAV, incorporating some EFV capabilities but in a more practical and cost-efficient manner. In concert with the ACV, the Marines were developing the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) to serve as a survivable and mobile platform to transport Marines when ashore. The MPC was not intended to be amphibious like an AAV, EFV, or the ACV but instead would be required to have a swim capability for inland waterways such as rivers, lakes, and other water obstacles such as shore-to-shore operations in the littorals. Both vehicles were intended to play central roles in future Marine amphibious operations. On June 14, 2013, Marine leadership put the MPC program \"on ice\" due to budgetary pressures but suggested the program might be resurrected some 10 years down the road when budgetary resources might be more favorable. In what was described as a \"drastic shift,\" the Marines decided to \"resurrect\" the MPC in March 2014. The Marines designated the MPC as ACV Increment 1.1 and planned to acquire about 200 vehicles. The Marines also plan to develop ACV Increment 1.2, a tracked, fully amphibious version, and at the time planned to acquire about 470 vehicles and fund an ongoing high water speed study. Although ACV Increment 1.1 is to have a swim capability, another mode of transport (ship or aircraft) would be required to get the vehicles from ship to shore. The Marines are reportedly exploring the possibility of developing a high water speed ACV 2.0, which could accompany tanks and light armored vehicles into combat. On November 5, 2014, the Marines released a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for ACV Increment 1.1. On November 24, 2015, the Marine Corps awarded BAE Systems and SAIC contracts to develop ACV 1.1 prototypes for evaluation. BAE's contract was for $103.8 million and SAIC's for $121.5 million, and each company was to build 16 prototypes to be tested over the next two years. Both BAE and SAIC delivered their prototypes early, and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) testing began mid-March 2017. In early December 2017, the Marines reportedly sent the ACV 1.1 down select request for proposals to BAE and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). On June 19, 2018, the Marine Corps selected BAE Systems to produce the ACV. The initial contract—valued at $198 million—was for low-rate production of 30 vehicles to be delivered by the autumn of 2019. On April 10, 2019, during testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Navy and Marine Corps leadership announced that during the fall of 2018, ACV 1.1 prototypes demonstrated satisfactory water mobility performance in high surf conditions and, in doing so, met the full water mobility transition requirement for ACV 1.2 capability. As a result, ACV 1.1 and ACV 1.2 were to be consolidated into a single variant—the ACV—which is intended to replace all AAVs. Potential issues for Congress include the potential ramifications of the consolidation of the ACV 1.1 and ACV 1.2 programs and how the possible adoption of the Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO) operational concept could affect the ACV program."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4254, "token_length": 7026, "chunk_ppl": [15.136957168579102, 6.8266191482543945, 5.2589616775512695, 8.942538261413574, 7.030884265899658, 7.8895087242126465, 10.564452171325684, 5.5174994468688965, 7.523332595825195, 3.977311849594116, 8.159894943237305, 7.208158493041992, 5.0925164222717285, 9.809774398803711, 8.375151634216309, 15.499496459960938, 11.99157428741455, 16.038440704345703, 9.671767234802246, 4.083307266235352, 6.434998035430908, 10.170315742492676, 10.385662078857422, 4.517052173614502, 7.539840221405029, 5.488524436950684, 3.2705302238464355, 4.364130020141602, 3.5328195095062256, 6.774367809295654, 6.841128349304199, 7.182632923126221, 6.788116455078125, 3.202699899673462, 5.980362892150879, 7.18323278427124, 9.632244110107422, 4.717724800109863, 4.4226861000061035, 6.5769572257995605, 10.357144355773926, 11.23639965057373, 10.275253295898438, 5.866146564483643, 7.3072991371154785, 9.109325408935547, 10.10230541229248, 7.713013172149658, 6.567911148071289, 4.122613430023193, 11.023374557495117], "total_ppl": 7.1496076583862305, "block_sizes": [27, 11, 32, 8, 26, 8, 11, 14, 32, 32, 10, 17, 12, 19, 30, 11, 8, 9, 16, 9, 14, 16, 12, 9, 16, 23, 14, 8, 20, 17, 12, 10, 16, 10, 9, 24, 9, 9, 12, 9, 32, 9, 18, 16, 9, 17, 12, 9, 9, 9, 13, 14, 8, 11, 9, 12, 10, 13, 9, 20, 9, 14, 31, 17, 8, 17, 9, 11, 10, 11, 10, 9, 14, 12, 19, 22, 9, 18, 8, 10, 32, 10, 12, 25, 17, 10, 25, 13, 18, 9, 19, 17, 16, 21, 32, 8, 17, 24, 13, 11, 14, 9, 13, 8, 9, 24, 21, 11, 8, 9, 23, 13, 11, 10, 9, 11, 25, 11, 9, 9, 10, 14, 8, 15, 25, 13, 16, 11, 10, 8, 8, 8, 10, 11, 11, 8, 10, 13, 8, 8, 9, 9, 17, 10, 14, 11, 10, 12, 8, 10, 19, 10, 10, 8, 8, 8, 11, 9, 8, 8, 19, 8, 9, 11, 14, 8, 10, 16, 11, 31, 11, 11, 10, 18, 32, 17, 14, 28, 11, 15, 28, 8, 12, 27, 13, 24, 15, 15, 22, 26, 30, 9, 8, 11, 9, 9, 10, 9, 13, 17, 14, 10, 19, 16, 13, 22, 10, 12, 12, 13, 14, 8, 32, 23, 14, 10, 17, 17, 10, 10, 9, 12, 19, 15, 22, 20, 11, 9, 16, 11, 15, 11, 32, 21, 9, 8, 8, 10, 32, 11, 19, 13, 13, 9, 9, 18, 27, 13, 11, 9, 26, 32, 32, 32, 20, 15, 11, 16, 9, 12, 8, 16, 8, 8, 10, 10, 10, 26, 18, 11, 9, 14, 8, 11, 14, 8, 11, 9, 23, 8, 16, 10, 10, 16, 13, 14, 26, 10, 23, 23, 8, 19, 9, 14, 14, 13, 8, 16, 18, 29, 8, 11, 11, 22, 8, 16, 18, 12, 15, 8, 13, 15, 9, 19, 9, 9, 8, 8, 17, 25, 9, 10, 14, 15, 14, 8, 8, 23, 25, 9, 15, 10, 8, 24, 13, 21, 8, 19, 20, 27, 13, 19, 20, 14, 22, 9, 13, 12, 12, 12, 10, 23, 23, 10, 12, 16, 12, 9, 10, 8, 8, 9, 11, 15, 8, 11, 11, 17, 14, 8, 8, 9, 15, 13, 10, 8, 13, 8, 9, 12, 10, 9, 11, 8, 19, 14, 9, 13, 12, 12, 11, 8, 8, 8, 10, 12, 16, 11, 23, 14, 14, 23, 11, 23, 12, 9, 11, 9, 17, 15, 9, 20, 13, 9, 10, 13, 11, 15, 9, 10, 13], "mean_block_size": 13.919239904988123, "generation_time": 581.7364985942841}

Matters of particular significance to U.S.-Israel relations include Israel's ability to address the threats it faces in its region. Shared U.S.-Israel concerns about Iran and its allies on the nuclear issue and in Syria and Lebanon. Israeli-Palestinian issues. Israeli domestic political issues, including elections scheduled for 2019. Israel relies on a number of strengths to manage potential threats to its security and existence. It maintains conventional military superiority relative to neighboring states and the Palestinians. It also takes measures to deter attack and defend its population and borders from evolving asymmetric threats such as rockets and missiles, cross-border tunneling, drones, and cyberattacks. Additionally, Israel has an undeclared but presumed nuclear weapons capability. Against a backdrop of strong bilateral cooperation, Israel's leaders and supporters routinely make the case that Israel's security and the broader stability of the region remain critically important for U.S. interests. A 10-year bilateral military aid memorandum of understanding (MOU)—signed in 2016—commits the United States to provide Israel $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing annually from FY2019 to FY2028, along with additional amounts from Defense Department accounts for missile defense. All of these amounts remain subject to congressional appropriations. Israeli officials seek to counter Iranian regional influence and prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu released new Israeli intelligence on Iran's nuclear program in April 2018, days before President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 international agreement that constrains Iran's nuclear activities. It is unclear whether Israel might take future military action in Iran if Iranian nuclear activities resume. Since 2018, Israel has conducted a number of military operations in Syria against Iran and its allies, including Lebanese Hezbollah. Israel and Iran also appear to be competing for military advantage over each other at the Israel-Lebanon border. Amid uncertainty in the area, in March 2019 President Trump recognized Israel's claim to sovereignty over the Golan Heights, changing long-standing U.S. policy that held—in line with U.N. Security Council Resolution 497 from 1981—the Golan was occupied Syrian territory whose final status was subject to Israel-Syria negotiation. The prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace process are complicated by many factors. Palestinian leaders cut off high-level political contacts with the Trump Administration after it recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017. U.S.-Palestinian tensions have since worsened amid U.S. cutoffs of funding to the Palestinians and diplomatic moves—including the May 2018 opening of the U.S. embassy to Israel in Jerusalem. Palestinian leaders interpreted these actions as prejudicing their claims to a capital in Jerusalem and to a just resolution of Palestinian refugee claims. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has welcomed these U.S. actions. The Trump Administration has suggested that it will release a proposed peace plan after Israeli elections, which are scheduled for April 9, 2019. Speculation continues about how warming ties between Israel and Arab Gulf states may affect Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy, though Saudi Arabia said that the U.S. policy change on the Golan Heights would negatively affect the peace process. Bouts of tension and violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza have continued—reportedly accompanied by indirect talks between the two parties that are being brokered by Egypt and aim for a long-term cease-fire.

In accordance with the DHS Appropriations Act, 2007, DHS established the CFATS program in 2007 to, among other things, identify and assess the security risk posed by chemical facilities. DHS inspects high-risk facilities after it approves facility security plans to ensure that the facilities are implementing required security measures and procedures. This statement summarizes progress and challenges related to DHS's CFATS program management. This statement is based on prior products GAO issued from July 2012 through June 2017, along with updates conducted in June 2018 on DHS actions to address prior GAO recommendations. To conduct the prior work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DHS policies for administering the CFATS program, how DHS assesses risk, and data on high-risk chemical facilities. GAO also interviewed DHS officials and reviewed information on DHS actions to implement its prior recommendations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress addressing challenges that GAO's past work identified to managing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. The following summarizes progress made and challenges remaining in key aspects of the program. Identifying high-risk chemical facilities. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS used self-reported and unverified data to determine the risk of facilities holding toxic chemicals that could threaten surrounding communities if released. GAO recommended that DHS should better verify the accuracy of facility-reported data. DHS implemented this recommendation by revising its methodology so it now calculates the risk of toxic release, rather than relying on facilities to do so. Assessing risk and prioritizing facilities. In April 2013, GAO reported weaknesses in multiple aspects of DHS's risk assessment and prioritization approach. GAO made two recommendations for DHS to review and improve this process, including that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all of the elements of consequence, threat, and vulnerability associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals. DHS launched a new risk assessment methodology in October 2016 and is currently gathering new or updated data from about 27,000 facilities to (1) determine which facilities should be categorized as high-risk because of the threat of sabotage, theft or diversion, or a toxic release and (2) assign those facilities deemed high risk to one of four risk-based tiers. GAO has ongoing work assessing these efforts and will report later this summer on the extent to which they fully address prior recommendations. Reviewing and approving facilities' site security plans . DHS is to review security plans and visit facilities to ensure their security measures meet DHS standards. In April 2013, GAO reported a 7 to 9 year backlog for these reviews and visits. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS had made substantial progress in addressing the backlog—estimating that it could take between 9 and 12 months for DHS to review and approve security plans for the approximately 900 remaining facilities. DHS has since taken additional action to expedite these activities and has eliminated this backlog. Inspecting facilities and ensuring compliance. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS conducted compliance inspections at 83 of the 1,727 facilities with approved security plans. GAO found that nearly half of the inspected facilities were not fully compliant with their approved security plans and that DHS did not have documented procedures for managing facilities' compliance. GAO recommended that DHS document procedures for managing compliance. As a result, DHS has developed an enforcement procedure and a draft compliance inspection procedure and expects to finalize the compliance inspection procedure by the end of fiscal year 2018. GAO has made various recommendations to strengthen DHS's management of the CFATS program, with which DHS has generally agreed. DHS has implemented or described planned actions to address most of these recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2363, "token_length": 3802, "chunk_ppl": [15.148246765136719, 7.546146869659424, 5.24782657623291, 5.498611927032471, 11.316084861755371, 5.429958343505859, 5.6963653564453125, 6.164444923400879, 6.635522842407227, 5.087127208709717, 5.781011581420898, 4.992196083068848, 5.108243465423584, 5.981213569641113, 4.2550272941589355, 6.803683280944824, 11.791923522949219, 3.8726861476898193, 7.029684066772461, 4.956122875213623, 5.614014625549316, 7.5698771476745605, 4.8509039878845215, 6.041440963745117, 8.17595100402832, 3.484489917755127], "total_ppl": 6.207447528839111, "block_sizes": [20, 17, 27, 12, 25, 20, 32, 32, 29, 9, 23, 8, 19, 29, 10, 19, 19, 19, 22, 32, 11, 32, 12, 12, 8, 9, 13, 8, 8, 8, 10, 20, 14, 14, 14, 8, 9, 14, 10, 31, 21, 9, 13, 12, 32, 19, 18, 10, 13, 10, 32, 10, 10, 9, 14, 29, 16, 16, 15, 10, 9, 25, 8, 11, 10, 27, 22, 29, 10, 11, 8, 17, 10, 25, 9, 15, 9, 14, 13, 9, 13, 10, 14, 14, 9, 12, 11, 12, 8, 11, 13, 30, 16, 19, 8, 13, 28, 24, 23, 11, 9, 11, 24, 13, 12, 10, 12, 15, 12, 9, 14, 11, 23, 14, 9, 25, 10, 29, 17, 10, 14, 12, 15, 8, 13, 18, 11, 20, 8, 10, 16, 22, 10, 8, 12, 11, 21, 16, 9, 10, 23, 12, 25, 32, 20, 15, 8, 14, 20, 12, 8, 13, 15, 22, 12, 8, 10, 11, 22, 10, 9, 18, 13, 32, 11, 8, 22], "mean_block_size": 15.41317365269461, "generation_time": 432.88995361328125}

The report suggests that proposals for an \"automatic continuing resolution\" have been considered to avoid funding gaps, but none have been enacted into law on a permanent basis. The report concludes by summarizing the recent funding gaps in FY2014, FY2018, and FY2019, and their respective impacts on government operations and employees.", "answers": ["The Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341-1342, 1511-1519) generally bars the obligation of funds in the absence of appropriations. Exceptions are made under the act, including for activities involving \"the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" The interval during the fiscal year when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law, either in the form of a regular appropriations act or a continuing resolution (CR), is referred to as a funding gap or funding lapse. Although funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year, they may also occur any time a CR expires and another CR (or the regular appropriations bill) is not enacted immediately thereafter. Multiple funding gaps may occur within a fiscal year. When a funding gap occurs, federal agencies are generally required to begin a shutdown of the affected projects and activities, which includes the prompt furlough of non-excepted personnel. The general practice of the federal government after the shutdown has ended has been to retroactively pay furloughed employees for the time they missed, as well as employees who were required to come to work. Although a shutdown may be the result of a funding gap, the two events should be distinguished. This is because a funding gap may result in a total shutdown of all affected projects or activities in some instances but not others. For example, when funding gaps are of a short duration, agencies may not have enough time to complete a shutdown of affected projects and activities before funding is restored. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget has previously indicated that a shutdown of agency operations within the first day of the funding gap may be postponed if a resolution appears to be imminent. Since FY1977, 20 funding gaps occurred, ranging in duration from 1 day to 34 full days. These funding gaps are listed in Table 1. About half of these funding gaps were brief (i.e., three days or less in duration). Notably, many of the funding gaps do not appear to have resulted in a \"shutdown.\" Prior to the issuance of the opinions in 1980 and early 1981 by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, while agencies tended to curtail some operations in response to a funding gap, they often \"continued to operate during periods of expired funding.\" In addition, some of the funding gaps after the Civiletti opinions did not result in a completion of shutdown operations due to both the funding gap's short duration and an expectation that appropriations would soon be enacted. Some of the funding gaps during this period, however, did have a broader impact on affected government operations, even if only for a matter of hours. Two funding gaps occurred in FY1996, amounting to 5 days and 21 days. The chronology of regular and continuing appropriations enacted during FY1996 is illustrated in Figure 1. At the beginning of FY2014 (October 1, 2013), none of the regular appropriations bills had been enacted, so a government-wide funding gap occurred. It concluded on October 17, 2013, after lasting 16 full days. During FY2018, there was a funding gap when a CR covering all of the regular appropriations bills expired on January 19, 2018. It concluded on January 22, 2018, after lasting two full days. The most recent funding gap occurred during FY2019, when a CR covering federal agencies and activities funded in 7 of the 12 regular appropriations bills expired on December 21, 2018. It concluded on January 25, 2019, after lasting 34 full days.

Each PMA operates in a distinct geographic area. Congressional interest in the PMAs has included diverse issues such as rate setting, cost and compliance associated with the Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205; 16 U.S.C. §§1531 et seq.), and questions of privatization of these federal agencies. In general, the PMAs came into being because of the government's need to dispose of electric power produced by dams constructed largely for irrigation, flood control, or other purposes, and to achieve small community and farm electrification—that is, providing service to customers whom it would not have been profitable for a private utility to serve. With minor exceptions, these agencies market the electric power produced by federal dams constructed, owned, and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). By statute, PMAs must give preference to public utility districts and cooperatives (e.g., \"preference customers\"), and sell their power at cost-based rates set at the lowest possible rate consistent with sound business principles. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates PMA rates to ensure that they are set high enough to repay the U.S. Treasury for the portion of federal facility costs allocated to hydropower beneficiaries. With energy and capacity markets changing in the western United States (especially with the growing need to integrate increasing amounts of variable renewable sources), and the development of the Energy Imbalance Market in the West, BPA and WAPA may have to adapt their plans with regard to generation needs and how transmission systems are developed. In 2018, the Trump Administration proposed to sell the transmission assets (lines, towers, substations, and/or rights of way) owned and operated by the federal Power Marketing Administrations. The proposal suggested that \"eliminating or reducing\" the federal government's role in owning and operating transmission assets, and increasing the private sector's role, would \"encourage a more efficient allocation of economic resources and mitigate unnecessary risk to taxpayers.\" The resulting PMA entities would then contract with other utilities to provide transmission services for the delivery of federal power, similar to what SEPA does currently. Reportedly, the proposed sale of PMA assets was dropped after opposition to the plan emerged from stakeholders. Under Section 208 of the Urgent Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1986 (P.L. 99-349), the executive branch is prohibited from spending funds to study or draft proposals to transfer from federal control any portion of the assets of the PMAs unless specifically authorized by Congress. Environmental, fishing, and tribal advocates have sued the federal government over concerns that operating rules for hydropower dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers (i.e., the National Marine Fisheries Service Biological Opinion) are inadequate to ensure survival of species threatened or endangered under the ESA. In 2016, a federal judge overturned a previous management plan for the dams, finding that it would not be sufficient to protect salmon runs, and ordered a new management plan that could include removing the dams.

{"id": 45, "pred": "The report discusses the role and responsibilities of the minority leader in the United States House of Representatives. The minority leader, who is the head of the opposition party, hands the gavel to the Speaker-elect during the start of a new Congress. The position illustrates the subordinate status of the minority party in an institution that operates under majority rule. The primary goal of any minority leader is to recapture majority control of the House.\n\nMinority leaders are elected every two years by secret ballot of their party caucus or conference and are typically experienced lawmakers. They serve as the spokesperson and leader of their party, and participate in certain institutional prerogatives. Their duties are not well-defined and are based on tradition and custom.\n\nThe position of minority leader emerged officially as a party position during the latter part of the 19th century, when strong partisan attachments, resilient patronage-based party organizations, and high levels of party voting in Congress made it conducive to the establishment of a more highly differentiated House leadership structure.\n\nMinority leaders have formal and informal party responsibilities, including nominating party members to committees, appointing a leadership member to the Committee on the Budget, and handling a wide range of informal party activities. They also have institutional obligations, such as attending meetings of the Intelligence Committee, appointing individuals to federal entities, and serving on various commissions and groups.\n\nThe minority leader faces challenges in promoting and publicizing the party's priorities, serving the interests of rank-and-file members, managing intraparty conflict, and forging party unity. The ultimate goal is to lead the party into majority status, but the strategies for achieving this goal vary depending on a range of circumstances. The report concludes that the minority party in the House faces a strategic problem: how to respond when given only a small slice of the legislative pie. The minority party must decide whether to accept the slice, bargain for more, or use every means at their disposal to win the right to cut the pie themselves.", "answers": ["The House minority leader, the head of the \"loyal opposition,\" is elected every two years by secret ballot of his or her party caucus or conference. The minority leader occupies a number of important institutional and party roles and responsibilities, and his or her fundamental goal is to recapture majority control of the House. From a party perspective, the minority leader has a wide range of assignments, all geared toward retaking majority control of the House. Five principal party activities direct the work of the minority leader. First, he or she provides campaign assistance to party incumbents and challengers. Second, the minority leader devises strategies, in consultation with like-minded colleagues, to advance party objectives. Third, the minority leader works to promote and publicize the party's agenda. Fourth, the minority leader, if his or her party controls the White House, confers regularly with the President and his aides about issues before Congress, the Administration's agenda, and political events generally. Fifth, the minority leader strives to promote party harmony so as to maximize the chances for legislative and political success. From an institutional perspective, the rules of the House assign a number of specific responsibilities to the minority leader. For example, Rule XIII, clause 6, grants the minority leader (or a designee) the right to offer a motion to recommit with instructions; and Rule II, clause 6, states that the Inspector General shall be appointed by joint recommendation of the Speaker, majority leader, and minority leader.

{"id": 46, "pred": "The UN has carried out 71 peacekeeping operations since 1948, with eight currently in sub-Saharan Africa. UN peacekeeping operations have evolved from military-focused missions to multidimensional ones, which include civilian and police personnel in addition to military personnel. These multidimensional operations aim to create a secure environment while implementing peace agreements and political processes. The UN's approved budget for peacekeeping operations in UN fiscal year 2017 was $7.9 billion, with individual operation budgets ranging from $36 million to over $1.2 billion. The UN's Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) is an example of a multidimensional peacekeeping operation. MINUSCA was established in response to escalating violence in CAR and has tasks including protecting civilians, supporting peace implementation, and promoting human rights. The UN reported that MINUSCA maintained 95,544 uniformed peacekeepers, international civilians, local civilians, and UN volunteers. The United States is the largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping operations, contributing an average of $2.1 billion per year from fiscal years 2014 to 2017. The UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations have different strengths, with the UN benefiting from international and local acceptance, access to global expertise, and the ability to leverage multilateral assistance. The UN's costs for MINUSCA totaled approximately $2.4 billion over three years and three months. A hypothetical, comparable U.S. operation in CAR would likely cost nearly $5.7 billion, more than twice the UN cost for MINUSCA. Factors contributing to the difference in costs include disparities in the cost of sourcing and transporting equipment and supplies, staffing and compensating military and police personnel, and maintaining facilities and communications and intelligence systems.", "answers": ["To promote international peace and security, the UN had 16 ongoing peacekeeping operations worldwide as of June 30, 2017, with a total budget of almost $8 billion in UN fiscal year 2017 and contributions of over 100,000 military, police, and civilian personnel from more than 120 countries. The United States is the largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping operations, providing an average of about 28 percent of total funding annually. The Department of State Authorities Act, Fiscal Year 2017, includes a provision for GAO to compare the costs, strengths, and limitations of UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations. This report (1) compares the reported costs of a specific UN operation to the estimated costs of a hypothetical, comparable operation implemented by the United States; (2) identifies factors that affect cost differences; and (3) identifies stakeholder views on the relative strengths of UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations. GAO worked with the UN, DOD, and State to generate a cost estimate of a hypothetical U.S.-led operation in the Central African Republic comparable to MINUSCA. GAO developed this estimate using DOD's cost estimating tool for contingency operations and State data on civilian costs, assuming a U.S. operation using roughly the same levels of military and civilian personnel as MINUSCA. The cost estimate should not be construed as suggesting that the United States would likely implement such an operation in the Central African Republic or that it would implement such an operation in the same way. GAO is making no recommendations. Based on United Nations (UN) and Departments of Defense (DOD) and State (State) data, GAO estimates that it would cost the United States more than twice as much as it would cost the UN to implement a hypothetical operation comparable to the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA). MINUSCA cost the UN approximately $2.4 billion for the first 39 months of the operation. GAO estimates that a hypothetical U.S. peacekeeping operation in the Central African Republic of roughly the same size and duration would cost nearly $5.7 billion—almost eight times more than the $700 million the United States contributed to MINUSCA over the same time period. Various factors affect differences between the actual cost of MINUSCA and the estimated cost of a hypothetical, comparable U.S. operation in the Central African Republic. The United States and the UN would source and transport some supplies and equipment differently, affecting the cost of both operations; for example, the United States would airlift water into the Central African Republic, while the UN does not do so to the same extent. The United States also would incur the cost of civilian police and military reservist salaries, while the UN does not pay any troop or police salaries. Finally, some higher standards for facilities, intelligence, and medical services increase the U.S. cost estimate relative to UN costs for similar operational elements. UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations have various relative strengths, according to U.S. and UN officials.

{"id": 47, "pred": "The report details the history and significance of Congressional Gold Medals, which have been awarded by Congress since the late 1700s to recognize distinguished contributions, perpetuate the remembrance of great events, and express public gratitude. The tradition began with the Continental Congress, which authorized the first gold medals for Revolutionary military leaders. Gold medals were also awarded for non-military achievements and heroic acts starting in the late 1800s. There are no permanent statutory provisions for creating Congressional Gold Medals, and the number of medals issued per year is not limited. The report discusses the legislative process for authorizing and designing these medals, as well as considerations for Members of Congress when introducing gold medal legislation. The report concludes by emphasizing the importance of Congressional Gold Medals as a way for Congress to honor national achievement in various fields.", "answers": ["Senators and Representatives are frequently asked to support or sponsor proposals recognizing historic events and outstanding achievements by individuals or institutions. Among the various forms of recognition that Congress bestows, the Congressional Gold Medal is often considered the most distinguished. Through this venerable tradition—the occasional commissioning of individually struck gold medals in its name—Congress has expressed public gratitude on behalf of the nation for distinguished contributions for more than two centuries. Since 1776, this award, which initially was bestowed on military leaders, has also been given to such diverse individuals as Sir Winston Churchill and Bob Hope, George Washington and Robert Frost, Joe Louis and Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Congressional gold medal legislation generally has a specific format. Once a gold medal is authorized, it follows a specific process for design, minting, and awarding. This process includes consultation and recommendations by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Commission (CCAC) and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), pursuant to any statutory instructions, before the Secretary of the Treasury makes the final decision on a gold medal's design. Once the medal has been struck, a ceremony will often be scheduled to formally award the medal to the recipient. In recent years, the number of gold medals awarded has increased, and some have expressed interest in examining the gold medal awarding process. Should Congress want to make such changes, several individual and institutional options might be available. The individual options include decisions made by Members of Congress as to what individual or groups might be honored; potential specification of gold medal design elements; and where gold medals for groups might be housed once the award is made. The institutional options could include House, Senate, or committee rules for the consideration of gold medal legislation and whether statutory standards on the number of gold medals issued per year or per Congress might be established for gold medals."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3411, "token_length": 5254, "chunk_ppl": [19.832345962524414, 11.330750465393066, 11.697176933288574, 5.893331050872803, 5.61983060836792, 4.362674236297607, 11.6336669921875, 5.608354568481445, 6.469404220581055, 3.6544344425201416, 5.817355632781982, 6.72135591506958, 7.187956809997559, 4.349180698394775, 6.37197732925415, 7.3187737464904785, 4.007981777191162, 4.914693355560303, 3.2902064323425293, 4.695621013641357, 5.318723678588867, 5.6190595626831055, 6.523614883422852, 10.660717010498047, 9.963227272033691, 4.639669895172119, 10.17176342010498, 4.411880970001221, 7.9303812980651855, 9.501276969909668, 7.477063179016113, 4.366926670074463, 7.460421085357666, 8.041437149047852, 4.023345470428467, 1.7334132194519043, 5.998239517211914, 413504.84375], "total_ppl": 6.31758975982666, "block_sizes": [20, 32, 13, 15, 16, 32, 32, 13, 11, 15, 8, 8, 9, 11, 8, 14, 9, 8, 24, 11, 12, 10, 16, 32, 28, 9, 31, 28, 8, 14, 13, 31, 11, 13, 24, 14, 8, 13, 22, 12, 10, 8, 20, 31, 16, 12, 9, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 11, 9, 9, 20, 9, 14, 8, 8, 14, 31, 13, 19, 10, 9, 14, 13, 9, 20, 18, 8, 11, 14, 8, 11, 10, 22, 25, 31, 8, 23, 32, 10, 11, 10, 8, 9, 8, 16, 12, 21, 8, 27, 8, 19, 9, 10, 22, 10, 11, 9, 16, 10, 8, 10, 12, 15, 32, 12, 10, 8, 32, 8, 10, 8, 12, 12, 11, 29, 10, 13, 10, 15, 14, 29, 10, 12, 16, 8, 13, 8, 17, 13, 31, 21, 16, 10, 31, 32, 21, 8, 13, 8, 19, 9, 20, 31, 12, 32, 18, 8, 20, 9, 11, 27, 14, 9, 8, 18, 8, 31, 10, 9, 11, 8, 9, 9, 16, 15, 32, 9, 10, 14, 14, 13, 8, 8, 9, 18, 16, 15, 14, 25, 11, 29, 11, 8, 8, 10, 9, 13, 8, 13, 12, 10, 15, 12, 14, 11, 11, 11, 11, 8, 10, 9, 9, 20, 10, 10, 10, 8, 13, 11, 8, 14, 15, 20, 10, 12, 32, 29, 14, 10, 13, 11, 9, 15, 13, 10, 17, 11, 10, 11, 8, 12, 9, 14, 8, 10, 32, 11, 13, 26, 12, 8, 20, 17, 13, 11, 19, 10, 16, 10, 18, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 21, 10, 13, 16, 9, 13, 8, 10, 22], "mean_block_size": 14.267657992565056, "generation_time": 296.5137507915497}
{"id": 48, "pred": "The report highlights the role of Cobra Dane and other radar systems in supporting various missions for the Department of Defense (DOD), including ballistic missile defense, space surveillance, and intelligence-gathering. Radar systems contribute to ballistic missile defense by tracking and classifying missile threats, determining if a threat was intercepted successfully, and providing discrimination capabilities to identify warheads from decoys. Radar systems can also support space surveillance missions by tracking space objects and their movements, and contribute to intelligence-gathering. The report also discusses the funding and operational responsibilities for Cobra Dane and other radar systems, with various offices within the Air Force and Missile Defense Agency overseeing their operation and sustainment. The report notes that the location of each radar system affects its ability to provide various capabilities for DOD's missions. For example, Cobra Dane's location at Shemya Island allows it to track missile threats earlier in their trajectories than other radars, providing an earlier opportunity for interception. The report also identifies ongoing modernization projects for Cobra Dane's systems and the cost-effectiveness of constructing and sustaining the radar at different locations. Overall, the report emphasizes the importance of radar systems in supporting DOD's missions and the ongoing efforts to maintain and upgrade these systems.", "answers": ["First fielded in 1976 on Shemya Island in Alaska, the Cobra Dane radar faces growing sustainment challenges that DOD plans to address through modernization projects. Anticipating future needs, DOD began investing in new radar systems that share capabilities with Cobra Dane to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, including the LRDR (Alaska), the Space Fence (Marshall Islands), and the Pacific Radar (location to be determined). The conference report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision that GAO review the Air Force's report to Congress on the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane. This report identifies information included in the Air Force's report and describes additional information that GAO reviewed on (1) the capabilities of the Cobra Dane radar and other planned radars to meet DOD's mission requirements, (2) Cobra Dane's operational availability and the plan to mitigate the effect on those missions when Cobra Dane is not available, and (3) DOD's funding plan and project cost estimates for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane and its site at Shemya Island. GAO reviewed the Air Force report and related documentation, and interviewed relevant officials. In its January 2018 report to Congress, the Air Force reported how the Cobra Dane radar and the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) have shared and unique capabilities to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance missions. The report noted that the respective locations of both radar systems affect their ability to provide those capabilities. The Department of Defense (DOD) also has other radar investments—the Pacific Radar and the Space Fence, which, according to DOD officials, may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane to provide ballistic missile defense and space surveillance capabilities. The Air Force's report to Congress noted that Cobra Dane met its requirement for operational availability, which refers to the percentage of time that the radar is able to meet its missions. GAO found that the Air Force has developed procedures to mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available. For example, U.S. Northern Command and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) officials stated that they can mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available by using the Sea-Based X-band radar to provide support for ballistic missile defense. The Air Force would face some limitations in its ability to conduct space surveillance if Cobra Dane were not available, as Cobra Dane tracks objects no other radar can track. However, MDA officials noted there are no plans to take Cobra Dane offline long enough to compromise space surveillance. The Air Force and MDA plan to contribute total funding of $278.6 million for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane, according to their fiscal year 2019 budget plans. Specifically, the Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of the Cobra Dane radar and for three modernization projects that make up their sustainment plan for the radar. Further, the Air Force report noted that the Air Force also plans to provide $140 million in funding for the sustainment and maintenance of operational access to Cobra Dane's site at Shemya Island. In addition, GAO found that the Air Force developed a total cost estimate for one project—known as the transmitter group replacement—but not for its other two projects.

Factors deterring participation include costs, uncertainty over regulations, and availability of alternative disposal methods. DEA officials stated that addressing cost issues and providing clearer guidance to authorized collectors are their priorities.", "answers": ["In 2015, 3.8 million Americans reported misusing prescription drugs within the last month, and deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled since 1999. About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2930, "token_length": 4523, "chunk_ppl": [9.324234962463379, 6.140265464782715, 9.11697769165039, 6.154269695281982, 9.445448875427246, 5.301418781280518, 5.324368000030518, 7.029114246368408, 4.935326099395752, 3.6150758266448975, 6.491044521331787, 4.075517654418945, 4.647421836853027, 3.697086811065674, 3.3561298847198486, 5.838271141052246, 4.585442066192627, 6.338015556335449, 6.385829448699951, 4.655726432800293, 6.6889848709106445, 4.132747173309326, 6.422011852264404, 6.055835723876953, 5.287572383880615, 6.176668167114258, 4.970529556274414, 5.963284969329834, 6.956435680389404, 4.260891437530518, 6.752025127410889, 39.93965148925781], "total_ppl": 5.734144687652588, "block_sizes": [9, 9, 32, 29, 19, 8, 14, 8, 16, 14, 10, 9, 8, 10, 12, 11, 21, 9, 23, 16, 8, 12, 12, 10, 20, 10, 13, 10, 15, 10, 9, 22, 11, 8, 29, 9, 14, 11, 12, 8, 20, 11, 12, 13, 8, 16, 15, 13, 22, 26, 20, 11, 10, 32, 32, 8, 18, 18, 10, 8, 15, 13, 9, 17, 16, 8, 9, 17, 18, 16, 17, 11, 25, 20, 10, 10, 12, 32, 23, 9, 8, 21, 26, 14, 11, 19, 16, 8, 10, 8, 9, 11, 26, 31, 25, 9, 8, 12, 26, 17, 10, 18, 15, 8, 10, 12, 11, 8, 16, 12, 17, 12, 8, 16, 11, 32, 32, 9, 11, 32, 13, 14, 17, 16, 23, 8, 8, 10, 31, 11, 14, 18, 8, 16, 17, 14, 25, 12, 8, 12, 8, 8, 10, 9, 9, 13, 17, 14, 14, 10, 8, 8, 8, 8, 16, 9, 10, 10, 8, 11, 11, 11, 9, 8, 10, 11, 11, 11, 10, 12, 14, 32, 9, 10, 15, 19, 13, 13, 13, 15, 10, 10, 16, 11, 9, 15, 23, 13, 20, 8, 29, 11, 16, 19, 8, 10, 9, 16, 8, 15, 16, 21, 16, 11, 20, 10, 10, 18, 31, 10, 26, 10, 10, 13, 26, 11, 10, 10, 15], "mean_block_size": 14.223744292237443, "generation_time": 284.405739068985}
{"id": 50, "pred": "The report outlines the process by which the House of Representatives expedites legislation through the suspension of rules procedure. This procedure allows for the consideration of non-privileged measures without a special rule, waiving points of order, limiting debate, and prohibiting floor amendments. The report provides statistical data on the prevalence and form of suspension measures during the 114th Congress, including their sponsors, committee consideration, length of floor debate, voting, and resolution of differences between the chambers. Most suspension measures were bills, and most were sponsored by members of the majority party. The majority of measures received broad support and were passed by the House, but not all were guaranteed passage in the Senate. Of the 703 law-making measures initially considered under suspension during the 114th Congress, 193 House bills, 82 Senate bills, and 1 House joint resolution became public law. The report also notes that the suspension procedure is typically used for measures that can meet a supermajority threshold and covers a wide range of policy areas, most often addressing government operations.", "answers": ["Suspension of the rules is the most commonly used procedure to call up measures on the floor of the House of Representatives. As the name suggests, the procedure allows the House to suspend its standing and statutory rules in order to consider broadly supported legislation in an expedited manner. More specifically, the House temporarily sets aside its rules that govern the raising and consideration of measures and assumes a new set of constraints particular to the suspension procedure. The suspension of the rules procedure has several parliamentary advantages: (1) it allows nonprivileged measures to be raised on the House floor without the need for a special rule, (2) it enables the consideration of measures that would otherwise be subject to a point of order, and (3) it streamlines floor action by limiting debate and prohibiting floor amendments. Given these features, as well as the required two-thirds supermajority vote for passage, suspension motions are generally used to process less controversial legislation. In the 114th Congress (2015-2016), measures considered under suspension made up 62% of the bills and resolutions that received floor action in the House (743 out of 1,200 measures). The majority of suspension measures were House bills (83%), followed by Senate bills (11%) and House resolutions (4%). The measures covered a variety of policy areas but most often addressed government operations, such as the designation of federal facilities or amending administrative policies. Most measures that are considered in the House under the suspension procedure are sponsored by a House or Senate majority party member. However, suspension is the most common House procedure used to consider minority-party-sponsored legislation regardless of whether the legislation originated in the House or Senate. In 2015 and 2016, minority-party members sponsored 31% of suspension measures, compared to 9% of legislation subject to different procedures, including privileged business (17 measures), unanimous consent (21 measures), and under the terms of a special rule (one Senate bill). Most suspension measures are referred to at least one House committee before their consideration on the floor. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (now called the Committee on Oversight and Reform) was the committee of primary jurisdiction for the plurality of suspension measures considered in the 114th Congress. Additional committees—such as Energy and Commerce, Homeland Security, Natural Resources, Foreign Affairs, and Veterans' Affairs—also served as the primary committee for a large number of suspension measures. Suspension motions are debatable for up to 40 minutes. In most cases, only a fraction of that debate time is actually used. In the 114th Congress, the average amount of time spent considering a motion to suspend the rules was 13 minutes and 10 seconds. The House adopted nearly every suspension motion considered in 2015 and 2016. Approval by the House, however, did not guarantee final approval in the 114th Congress. The Senate passed or agreed to 40% of the bills, joint resolutions, and concurrent resolutions initially considered in the House under suspension of the rules, and 276 measures were signed into law. This report briefly describes the suspension of the rules procedure, which is defined in House Rule XV, and provides an analysis of measures considered under this procedure during the 114th Congress. Figures and one table display statistics on the use of the procedure, including the prevalence and form of suspension measures, sponsorship of measures by party, committee consideration, length of debate, voting, resolution of differences between the chambers, and the final status of legislation.

Despite these challenges, NCA continues to work towards increasing burial access for veterans and their families.", "answers": ["The VA is responsible for ensuring that veterans have reasonable access to burial options in a national or state veterans' cemetery. In fiscal year 2018 VA estimated that about 92 percent of veterans had reasonable access to burial options, which was an increase from 90 percent in fiscal year 2014 but short of its goal of 96 percent by the end of fiscal year 2017. The House Appropriations Committee has expressed concerns that there are geographic pockets where veterans remain unserved by burial options. House Report 115-188 accompanying a bill for the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018, includes a provision for GAO to examine veterans' access to burial options. This report (1) describes VA's plan for increasing reasonable access to burial options for veterans and (2) assesses VA's progress in implementing its plan and any challenges experienced. GAO reviewed applicable VA and NCA documents, compared NCA's cost-estimating practices with GAO's cost-estimating 12 steps, and met with cognizant officials regarding NCA's efforts to provide reasonable access to burial options. Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) has a plan to establish 18 new national cemeteries to increase reasonable access to burial options for veterans. NCA defines reasonable access as a national or state veterans' cemetery being located within 75 miles of veterans' homes. Key parts of NCA's plan include establishing 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries and awarding grant funds to state applicants for establishing new state veterans' cemeteries. NCA has made limited progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access and is years behind its original schedule for opening new cemeteries. For example, NCA has opened only two of its planned urban and rural initiative sites and is behind its original schedule for the other 11 (see fig. below). The primary factor delaying NCA's completion of these cemeteries has been challenges in acquiring suitable land. NCA has also been challenged in producing accurate estimates of construction costs for most of its rural initiative sites. Cost estimates have increased more than 200 percent (from about $7 million to $24 million) for these sites, and NCA's guidance for developing cost estimates for the cemeteries does not fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in cost-estimating leading practices—such as conducting a risk and uncertainty analysis or a sensitivity analysis.

Elections are primarily administered by thousands of state and local systems rather than a single, unified national system. States and localities share responsibility for most election administration duties. Exactly how responsibilities are assigned at the state and local levels varies both between and within states, but there are some general patterns in the distribution of duties. States typically have primary responsibility for making decisions about the rules of elections (policymaking). Localities typically have primary responsibility for conducting elections in accordance with those rules (implementation). Localities, with varying contributions from states, typically also have primary responsibility for paying for the activities and resources required to conduct elections (funding). The structures of the state and local systems that conduct elections also vary between and within states. Common variations include differences related to the leadership of the system, the relationship between local election officials and the state, and the population size and density of the jurisdiction the system serves. The leadership of a state or local election system may be elected or appointed, and both the leaders and the methods used to select them may be partisan, bipartisan, or nonpartisan. State officials may have more or less direct influence over local election officials, and the extent of their influence may be affected by other structural features of the state's election systems, such as the methods used to select local officials. Finally, larger election jurisdictions have different administrative advantages and challenges than smaller ones, and more urban jurisdictions have different advantages and challenges than more rural ones. These differences between jurisdictions may be reflected in structural features of the election systems that serve them, such as how the systems allocate resources and where they find specialized expertise. Understanding the duties and structures of state and local election systems may be relevant to Congress for at least two reasons. First, the way state and local election systems work can affect how well federal action on election administration serves its intended purposes. The effectiveness of federal action depends in part on how it is implemented. How it is implemented can depend, in turn, on how the state and local election systems that implement it work. Second, Congress can make or incentivize changes to the way state and local election systems work. Congress has a number of policy tools it can use to affect the administration of federal elections. The use of these tools can—either intentionally or unintentionally—affect the state and local election systems that administer federal elections."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3965, "token_length": 5751, "chunk_ppl": [17.665857315063477, 6.726856231689453, 8.316730499267578, 4.044620037078857, 8.120092391967773, 7.2929277420043945, 7.229801177978516, 8.835647583007812, 10.352848052978516, 6.507411479949951, 5.822686672210693, 3.210076332092285, 4.477466106414795, 6.360790729522705, 4.837904453277588, 5.282791614532471, 4.80353307723999, 4.525860786437988, 8.509456634521484, 8.71243667602539, 4.9453654289245605, 6.14045524597168, 7.135036945343018, 7.605437278747559, 6.343082904815674, 6.7742180824279785, 6.8156938552856445, 5.965841293334961, 7.404048919677734, 7.001850128173828, 4.038041114807129, 9.05359935760498, 5.008829593658447, 6.514777183532715, 10.555678367614746, 5.590103626251221, 3.9414405822753906, 5.498148441314697, 4.160274505615234, 7.0403032302856445, 7.328017711639404], "total_ppl": 6.39285945892334, "block_sizes": [30, 27, 13, 25, 31, 24, 9, 32, 13, 9, 26, 9, 14, 15, 17, 25, 8, 32, 19, 10, 13, 13, 17, 18, 9, 17, 13, 9, 11, 22, 14, 12, 32, 10, 16, 12, 28, 14, 11, 14, 32, 9, 14, 8, 10, 31, 11, 17, 17, 8, 17, 16, 13, 9, 18, 13, 17, 12, 15, 26, 14, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 9, 8, 10, 9, 10, 8, 16, 12, 12, 31, 13, 17, 9, 25, 11, 10, 15, 14, 13, 18, 32, 16, 9, 32, 8, 10, 19, 20, 10, 23, 14, 24, 8, 8, 13, 29, 18, 14, 12, 10, 13, 8, 9, 12, 28, 10, 12, 11, 10, 31, 23, 12, 14, 12, 10, 20, 8, 15, 32, 16, 9, 29, 11, 9, 16, 17, 11, 29, 20, 32, 8, 18, 11, 10, 28, 23, 8, 11, 13, 9, 32, 8, 14, 14, 17, 12, 23, 12, 10, 9, 10, 8, 9, 13, 16, 27, 11, 12, 18, 11, 9, 13, 17, 8, 11, 11, 20, 8, 15, 8, 11, 8, 9, 23, 10, 15, 8, 14, 11, 24, 16, 12, 16, 9, 16, 17, 8, 8, 10, 22, 20, 14, 18, 21, 9, 18, 8, 17, 11, 18, 28, 8, 12, 10, 10, 10, 25, 17, 15, 10, 15, 12, 10, 9, 12, 10, 11, 9, 11, 26, 21, 12, 21, 13, 8, 11, 8, 23, 16, 27, 14, 11, 9, 13, 11, 8, 9, 8, 11, 13, 17, 9, 13, 8, 12, 9, 10, 32, 8, 23, 13, 28, 32, 8, 32, 11, 9, 10, 15, 16, 11, 23, 27, 8, 8, 14, 11, 16, 22, 16, 19, 9, 27, 8, 9, 8, 32, 18, 9, 17, 8, 14, 12, 11, 17], "mean_block_size": 14.969178082191782, "generation_time": 342.33570194244385}
{"id": 53, "pred": "The report discusses the history and current debates surrounding eligibility for the Purple Heart military award. Established by George Washington in 1782 as the Badge of Military Merit, the Purple Heart was intended to recognize meritorious actions by soldiers. However, it fell into disuse after the Revolutionary War. The award was revived in 1932 and renamed the Purple Heart, with eligibility expanded to include those wounded or killed in combat. In 1942, eligibility was extended to Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard members. In the following decades, eligibility was further expanded to include civilians, prisoners of war, and those wounded in terrorist attacks or peacekeeping operations.\n\nThe report highlights recent debates over eligibility for the Purple Heart in the context of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, particularly regarding the recognition of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as qualifying conditions. The report also discusses the controversy surrounding the application of the Purple Heart to terrorist attacks, as seen in the 2015 shootings at military facilities in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nThe report notes that veterans groups often voice their opinions on proposed changes to Purple Heart eligibility and that determining which actions and events warrant the award can be contentious. The report concludes by discussing the constitutional authority of Congress to make rules regarding military awards and the ongoing debates surrounding eligibility for the Purple Heart.", "answers": ["The Purple Heart is one of the oldest and most recognized American military medals, awarded to servicemembers who were killed or wounded by enemy action. The conflicts 2001 to the present have greatly increased the number of Purple Hearts awarded to servicemembers. Events over the past few years have spurred debate on the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart. Shootings on U.S. soil and medical conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have prompted changes to the eligibility requirements for the Purple Heart. Some critics believe that these changes may lessen the value of the medal and the sacrifices of past recipients on the battlefield. In the past, efforts to modify the Purple Heart's eligibility requirements were contentious, and veterans groups were vocal concerning eligibility changes. While medal requirements are often left to the military and executive branch to decide, Congress is involved in Purple Heart eligibility, utilizing its constitutional power \"To Make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\" (U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, clause 14). The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (P.L. 113-291) included language that expands eligibility for the Purple Heart. Previous debates have raised several questions about the Purple Heart. In some respects, how an event is defined can determine eligibility: Is a servicemember the victim of a crime or a terrorist attack?

The report serves as a valuable resource for understanding the complex web of laws and authorities governing federal land management.", "answers": ["The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, heavily concentrated in 12 western states. Four agencies—the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture—administer about 95% of those lands. The extent to which each of these four federal agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The agency also has other authorities for disposing of land, including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition, among other purposes, and a law that allows transfers to governmental units and other entities for public purposes. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the four federal agencies also varies. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many contend could benefit from federal management. Disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is no longer needed for a federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. Some of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used, such as the conveyance of FS land for educational purposes and the disposal of BLM land for recreation and public purposes. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; and the extent of federal land ownership overall. The current acquisition and disposal authorities form the backdrop for consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate authorities, or to provide for the acquisition or disposal of particular lands. In some cases, Congress enacts bills to provide authority to acquire or dispose of particular parcels where no standing authority exists and, in other cases, to direct or facilitate land transactions. Congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of debates on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally, and it has considered broader measures to dispose of lands or to promote acquisition. Other issues for Congress pertain to the sources and levels of funds for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the primary source of funding for land acquisition. Congress has considered diverse measures related to the LWCF, such as legislation to make LWCF funding permanent and bills to direct LWCF monies to additional, nonacquisition purposes. Additionally, the FWS has the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, an account with mandatory spending authority supported by revenue from three sources. The BLM also has mandatory spending authorities that allow the proceeds from land sales to be used for land acquisition, among other purposes."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4882, "token_length": 7647, "chunk_ppl": [9.092538833618164, 6.658935546875, 5.149266719818115, 8.12909984588623, 5.944009780883789, 5.568252086639404, 11.487282752990723, 4.5828399658203125, 6.855407238006592, 9.119183540344238, 10.279484748840332, 4.476393699645996, 4.97100305557251, 7.0935893058776855, 7.403899192810059, 5.7635817527771, 8.388476371765137, 4.251160144805908, 5.642526149749756, 3.7549376487731934, 6.830885410308838, 4.350768566131592, 4.110884666442871, 11.559067726135254, 6.038044452667236, 3.445281505584717, 5.993502140045166, 3.7455642223358154, 6.4527788162231445, 1.3198704719543457, 5.239415645599365, 6.127519607543945, 4.271565914154053, 4.302757740020752, 9.761648178100586, 4.686448097229004, 2.79227352142334, 13.434202194213867, 6.363007068634033, 5.535857677459717, 10.112955093383789, 5.748831272125244, 6.2900872230529785, 6.120169162750244, 5.192665100097656, 4.414430618286133, 4.19792366027832, 4.299250602722168, 5.955621719360352, 9.344472885131836, 6.995426654815674, 8.018487930297852, 7.068674564361572, 6.249809741973877, 6.1219611167907715, 11.833932876586914], "total_ppl": 5.943944454193115, "block_sizes": [13, 16, 9, 32, 8, 9, 12, 12, 28, 32, 13, 31, 14, 17, 12, 14, 10, 8, 19, 25, 10, 11, 9, 32, 8, 10, 9, 16, 17, 9, 32, 10, 17, 15, 11, 10, 17, 8, 12, 15, 16, 26, 17, 16, 9, 9, 8, 9, 22, 9, 9, 8, 9, 10, 24, 9, 19, 9, 8, 32, 14, 18, 8, 13, 25, 14, 19, 16, 19, 22, 13, 10, 9, 8, 9, 12, 18, 20, 13, 14, 10, 12, 17, 9, 21, 11, 10, 9, 19, 13, 11, 12, 9, 9, 13, 15, 8, 23, 20, 10, 9, 9, 18, 11, 20, 9, 18, 19, 11, 10, 8, 8, 8, 10, 10, 11, 10, 15, 25, 8, 14, 18, 10, 10, 13, 14, 8, 15, 10, 14, 17, 8, 11, 8, 15, 9, 8, 26, 12, 10, 22, 10, 17, 9, 15, 8, 16, 8, 15, 10, 24, 9, 9, 14, 14, 32, 10, 31, 13, 15, 8, 8, 20, 20, 9, 13, 22, 13, 12, 27, 22, 8, 27, 20, 15, 14, 12, 27, 13, 29, 9, 15, 20, 9, 28, 24, 20, 12, 11, 8, 13, 9, 18, 15, 18, 11, 9, 8, 22, 17, 10, 12, 9, 8, 8, 17, 9, 14, 8, 13, 13, 17, 21, 12, 10, 11, 16, 14, 12, 21, 21, 26, 8, 26, 9, 32, 22, 22, 30, 11, 8, 22, 15, 11, 31, 23, 21, 8, 9, 15, 10, 10, 11, 12, 10, 9, 20, 13, 9, 8, 9, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 22, 13, 15, 9, 32, 14, 10, 8, 13, 13, 8, 9, 8, 12, 20, 11, 15, 14, 9, 13, 22, 11, 20, 29, 16, 9, 16, 16, 13, 32, 12, 11, 20, 10, 16, 16, 12, 10, 10, 8, 8, 14, 21, 10, 8, 15, 22, 10, 10, 30, 9, 11, 8, 22, 12, 8, 32, 13, 32, 10, 20, 18, 11, 9, 8, 10, 13, 10, 10, 10, 8, 13, 14, 13, 16, 24, 31, 8, 18, 11, 13, 8, 14, 30, 21, 15, 19, 10, 8, 10, 11, 9, 12, 18, 18, 8, 15, 11, 8, 9, 31, 16, 19, 9, 17, 27, 32, 16, 11, 10, 11, 13, 9, 8, 9, 20, 12, 13, 10, 10, 9, 32, 16, 28, 32, 10, 15, 12, 14, 9, 22, 32, 21, 8, 10, 25, 11, 23, 13, 12, 19, 18, 10, 24, 32, 8, 8, 8, 23, 14, 15, 8, 18, 17, 17, 11, 12, 32, 11, 9, 13, 9, 15, 14, 11, 10, 18, 8, 9, 8, 8, 9, 14, 9, 11, 8, 11, 9, 11], "mean_block_size": 14.675862068965516, "generation_time": 505.0210087299347}
{"id": 55, "pred": "The report provides an overview of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and its executive, administrative, and professional (EAP) exemptions to overtime pay. The FLSA, enacted in 1938, requires employers to pay employees one-and-a-half times their regular rate for hours worked beyond 40 hours in a workweek, unless they meet the criteria for the EAP exemptions. The report discusses the history of DOL regulations on the EAP exemptions and the current criteria for qualifying: a salary basis test, a duties test, and a salary level test. The proposed 2019 rule would increase the salary level threshold for the EAP exemptions, potentially affecting approximately 4.9 million workers, including 1.3 million who would become newly entitled to overtime pay and 3.6 million with strengthened protections. The report also mentions that the FLSA applies to employees in U.S. territories and institutions of higher education, and that state and local governments are not exempt from the FLSA and overtime regulations.", "answers": ["The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), enacted in 1938, is the main federal law that establishes general wage and hour standards for most, but not all, private and public sector employees. Among other protections, the FLSA establishes that covered nonexempt employees must be compensated at one-and-a-half times their regular rate of pay for each hour worked over 40 hours in a workweek. The FLSA also establishes certain exemptions from its general labor market standards. One of the major exemptions to the overtime provisions in the FLSA is for bona fide \"executive, administrative, and professional\" employees (the \"EAP\" or \"white collar\" exemptions). The FLSA grants authority to the Secretary of Labor to define and delimit the EAP exemption \"from time to time.\" To qualify for this exemption from the FLSA's overtime pay requirement, an employee must be salaried (the \"salary basis\" test); perform specified executive, administrative, or professional duties (the \"duties\" test); and earn above an established salary level threshold (the \"salary level\" test). In March 2019, the Secretary of Labor published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to make changes to the EAP exemptions. The 2019 proposed rule would become effective around January 2020. The major changes in the 2019 proposed rule include increasing the standard salary level threshold from the previous level of $455 per week to $679 per week and committing the Department of Labor (DOL) to updating the EAP exemptions every four years through the rulemaking process. The 2019 proposed rule does not change the duties and responsibilities that employees must perform to be exempt.

{"id": 56, "pred": "The report outlines the goals of the U.S. Department of State (State) in implementing American foreign policy and representing the United States abroad, as outlined in its joint strategic plan for fiscal years 2018 through 2022. The report highlights the roles of Foreign Service generalists and specialists in achieving these goals, with generalists responsible for formulating and implementing U.S. foreign policy and collecting information from foreign governments and citizens, and specialists supporting and maintaining the functioning of overseas posts. The report notes that State may require Foreign Service employees to be available for service anywhere in the world, but generally does not use this authority, instead relying on other means to fill high-priority positions.\n\nThe report also discusses the limitations of State's Global Employment Management System (GEMS) data on Foreign Service staffing at overseas posts, including overstated vacancy numbers and temporary vacancies caused by rotating employees. The report found that as of March 31, 2018, 13% of State’s overseas Foreign Service positions were vacant, with the largest percentages of vacancies in the political, economic, and \"other\" generalist career tracks, as well as in the security officer, office management specialist, and information management specialist skill groups. The report concludes by recommending that the Secretary of State develop an integrated action plan to define the root causes of persistent Foreign Service vacancies and suggest corrective measures to reduce such vacancies. The report also notes that State has taken some steps to address vacancies but lacks a comprehensive action plan.", "answers": ["State staffs Foreign Service employees to more than 270 embassies and consulates worldwide to advance U.S. foreign policy and economic interests. In 2009 and 2012, GAO identified ongoing Foreign Service staffing gaps. GAO was asked to review State's Foreign Service staffing. This report examines (1) vacancies in State's Foreign Service staffing at overseas posts, (2) reported effects of Foreign Service vacancies on diplomatic readiness, and (3) State's efforts to address Foreign Service vacancies. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed State's Global Employment Management System data as of March 2018. The system includes information on Foreign Service and Civil Service positions, including the total number of authorized Foreign Service positions and whether each position is filled or vacant. GAO also reviewed its relevant prior reports and State workforce planning documents. In addition, GAO interviewed State staff at 10 overseas posts, selected on the basis of large numbers of Foreign Service vacancies and diversity in the types of Foreign Service positions that were vacant at these posts, among other factors. The Department of State's (State) data show persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts since 2008. According to the data, 13 percent of overseas Foreign Service positions were vacant as of March 2018. This percentage is similar to the percentages GAO reported for 2008 and 2012, when 14 percent of these positions were vacant. In addition, State's data show persistent vacancies at overseas posts in generalist positions that help formulate and implement U.S. foreign policy and in specialist positions that support and maintain the functioning of overseas posts. State's data also show persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts with State's highest foreign policy priorities and in regions with security risks that could threaten U.S. foreign policy interests. According to staff at overseas posts, Foreign Service vacancies adversely affect State's ability to carry out U.S. foreign policy. Staff at overseas posts told us that vacancies increase workloads, contributing to low morale and higher stress for Foreign Service staff and that vacancies in Political and Economic positions—20 percent and 16 percent, respectively—limit the reporting on political and economic issues that posts are able to provide to State headquarters. Notably, officials also stated that vacancies in specialist positions may heighten security risks at overseas posts and disrupt post operations. For instance, some overseas post staff said that vacancies in Information Management positions had increased the vulnerability of posts' computer networks to potential cybersecurity attacks and other malicious threats. State described various efforts—implemented by multiple offices in the department —to help address overseas Foreign Service vacancies, but these efforts are not guided by an integrated action plan to reduce persistent vacancies. An example of State's efforts is the “Hard-to-Fill” program, which allows Civil Service staff an opportunity to fill a Foreign Service vacancy on a single overseas tour. According to GAO's 2017 High-Risk Series report, an agency should design and implement an action plan—integrated across its relevant offices—that defines the root causes of all skills gaps and suggests corrective measures. However, State has not developed such an action plan for reducing persistent overseas Foreign Service vacancies. Without developing an integrated action plan, overseas Foreign Service vacancies may persist. As a result, State's ability to achieve U.S. foreign policy goals and help ensure secure and efficient operations could be adversely impacted. GAO recommends that State develop an integrated action plan that defines the root causes of persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts and suggests corrective measures to reduce such vacancies.

{"id": 57, "pred": "The report outlines the Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) transition from its legacy Medical Supply Program for Veterans (MSPV) to a new iteration, MSPV-NG. The legacy program prevented standardization of medical supplies across VHA's 170 medical centers, affecting their ability to leverage buying power and achieve cost savings. The transition to MSPV-NG involved various stakeholders, including the Procurement and Logistics Office, Strategic Acquisition Center, and clinical personnel. The program aims to standardize supply items, demonstrate cost avoidance, increase efficiency, and involve clinicians in requirements development.\n\nHowever, the implementation of MSPV-NG faced challenges, including a lack of a documented program strategy, leadership instability, and workforce capacity issues. The initial requirements development process relied heavily on data from previous clinician purchases and lacked clinician input. As a result, many medical centers reported difficulty finding matches or substitutes for needed items on the formulary, leading to low utilization rates.\n\nTo address these challenges, the VHA is recommended to develop and communicate a clear overall strategy for the program, prioritize supply categories for future phases, and involve national clinical program offices in requirements development and standardization efforts. The SAC is also recommended to establish a plan for mitigating potential risks of gaps in contract coverage while making competitive Phase 2 awards. The department plans to replace the current MSPV-NG contract and formulary process with a new approach where the prime vendor develops the formulary. Despite these efforts, challenges remain in fully achieving the goals of the MSPV-NG program.", "answers": ["VA spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually on medical supplies to meet the health care needs of about 7 million veterans. To provide a more efficient, cost-effective way for its medical centers to order supplies, the VA established the MSPV-NG program. The program's goals include involving clinicians in requirements development, leveraging buying power when making competitive awards, and consolidating supplies used across medical centers. VA began developing requirements in early 2015 and launched the program in December 2016. This testimony summarizes key information contained in GAO's November 2017 report, GAO-18-34 . Specifically, it addresses the extent to which VA's implementation of MSPV-NG has been effective in meeting program goals. GAO analyzed VA's requirements development and contracting processes, and identified key supply chain practices cited by four leading hospital networks. GAO also met with contracting and clinical officials at six medical centers, selected based on high dollar contract obligations in fiscal years 2014-2016 and geographic representation. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor-Next Generation (MSPV-NG) program to provide an efficient, cost-effective way for its facilities to order supplies, but its initial implementation did not have an overarching strategy, stable leadership, and workforce capacity that could have facilitated medical center buy-in for the change. VA also developed requirements for a broad range of MSPV-NG items with limited clinical input. Further, starting in June 2015, VA planned to award competitive contracts, but instead, 79 percent of the items available for purchase under MSPV-NG were added through non-competitive agreements. (See figure). As a result, the program did not meet the needs of medical centers, and usage remained below VA's 40 percent target. (See figure.) VA has taken steps to address some deficiencies and is developing a new approach to the program.

{"id": 58, "pred": "The report discusses the Postal Retiree Health Benefits provided through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) for approximately 500,000 postal retirees. The funding for these benefits is shared among USPS, the federal government, and retirees. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) of 2006 mandated that USPS begin fully prefunding retiree health benefits, leading to the establishment of the RHB Fund in the U.S. Treasury. However, USPS has missed approximately $38 billion in payments to the fund since fiscal year 2010, and the fund is projected to be depleted in 12 years under the status quo. The report suggests eight potential policy approaches to address the financial sustainability of postal retiree health benefits, including increasing retiree use of Medicare, supplemental federal appropriations, tightening eligibility or reducing benefits, and changing the federal contribution to a fixed subsidy. The report emphasizes the need for congressional action to address the issue and prevent disruption to postal retiree health benefits. USPS provided comments on the report, emphasizing the need for a fuller understanding of Medicare integration practices and the potential risks associated with outside investment. The report concludes by stating that all approaches have different potential effects and that it is up to Congress to determine the most appropriate action to take.", "answers": ["USPS is required to prefund its share of health benefits costs for its retirees. To do so, USPS is required to make payments into the RHB Fund, which is administered by OPM. However, USPS has not made any payments to the fund since fiscal year 2010. At the end of fiscal year 2017, USPS had missed $38.2 billion in payments, leaving the fund 44 percent funded. Pursuant to law, beginning in fiscal year 2017, OPM started drawing from the fund to cover USPS's share of postal retirees' health benefits premiums. GAO was asked to review issues related to the sustainability of the RHB Fund. This report examines (1) the financial outlook for the RHB Fund and (2) policy approaches for postal retiree health benefits, among other topics. GAO evaluated financial projections for the RHB Fund from OPM. GAO reviewed laws and regulations and identified policy approaches primarily by identifying legislative proposals, and literature on actions of companies and state governments to address retiree health benefits. These approaches are not exhaustive or mutually exclusive. GAO also interviewed experts in retiree health benefits and postal stakeholders, chosen on the basis of relevant publications and prior GAO work, and interviewed and obtained written responses from OPM and USPS officials. The financial outlook of the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund (RHB Fund) is poor. At the end of fiscal year 2017, the fund's assets declined to $49.8 billion and unfunded liabilities rose to $62.2 billion. Based on Office of Personnel Management (OPM) projections requested by GAO, the fund is on track to be depleted in fiscal year 2030 if the United States Postal Service (USPS) continues to make no payments into the fund. Annual payments of $1 billion or $2 billion into the fund would extend the projected depletion date by 2 to 5 years (see figure). USPS has said that its required payments to the fund are unaffordable relative to its current financial situation and outlook. For the past 11 years USPS has incurred large operating losses that it expects will continue. Additionally, USPS has stated that its opportunities for revenue generation and cost-cutting are limited. USPS reported that it did not make required fund payments in 2017 in order to preserve liquidity and cover operational costs. If the fund becomes depleted, USPS would be required by law to make the payments necessary to cover its share of health benefits premiums for current postal retirees. Current law does not address what would happen if the fund becomes depleted and USPS does not make payments to cover those premiums. Depletion of the fund could affect postal retirees as well as USPS, customers, and other stakeholders, including the federal government. About 500,000 postal retirees receive health benefits and OPM expects that number to remain about the same through 2035. GAO identified three categories of policy approaches for postal retiree health benefits, based on legislative proposals and pertinent literature. First, some approaches, such as generally requiring eligible postal retirees to participate in Medicare, would shift costs to the federal government. Second, some approaches would reduce benefits or increase costs to postal retirees and/or employees. Third, some approaches would change how benefits are financed (see table). All of these approaches have different potential effects and would require congressional action. Thus, it is up to Congress to consider the merits of different approaches and determine the most appropriate action to take. It would be preferable to take action when careful consideration is possible, rather than wait until lack of adequate funding could disrupt postal retiree health benefits. Congress should consider passing legislation to put postal retiree health benefits on a more sustainable financial footing.

Since then, the FBI's mission and workforce have expanded, leading to security concerns due to the dispersion of staff in annexes and leased spaces from foreign owners. The Hoover Building's space is largely unusable, and its original design is inefficient, making it difficult to meet the FBI's current and projected operational requirements.

One type of transaction, called a swap exchange, enables GSA to apply the value of federal property to finance construction without relying on appropriated funds. Under such an exchange, GSA transfers the title of the unneeded property to a private investor after receiving the agreed upon construction services at another location. GSA proposed a swap exchange procurement for construction of a new FBI headquarters building in exchange for the Hoover Building and appropriations to compensate for the difference in value between the Hoover Building and the new building. GSA cancelled this procurement in July 2017 due to lack of funding. This statement addresses (1) GSA's and FBI's assessments of the Hoover Building, (2) GSA efforts to implement swap exchanges, and (3) alternative approaches to funding real property projects. It is based on GAO's body of reports on real property from 2011 to 2017, and selected updates from GSA. In November 2011, GAO reported that, according to General Services Administration (GSA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assessments, the FBI's headquarters building (Hoover Building) and its accompanying facilities in Washington, D.C., did not fully support the FBI's long-term security, space, and building condition requirements. Since GAO's report, the assessments have not materially changed, for example: Security: GAO's prior work noted that the dispersion of staff in annexes creates security challenges, including where some space was leased by the FBI and other space was leased by nonfederal tenants. Earlier this year, GAO reported the FBI is leasing space in D.C. from foreign owners. Space : In 2011, GAO reported that FBI and GSA studies showed that much of the Hoover Building is unusable. GSA noted in its fiscal year 2017 project prospectus for the FBI headquarters consolidation that the Hoover Building cannot be redeveloped to meet the FBI's current needs. Building Condition: In GAO's 2011 report, GAO noted that the condition of the Hoover Building was deteriorating, and GSA assessments identified significant recapitalization needs. Since GAO's report and in response to GAO's recommendation, GSA has evaluated its approach to maintaining the building and completed some repairs to ensure safety. GSA has limited experience in successfully completing swap exchange transactions and chose not to pursue several proposed swap exchanges, most recently the planned swap exchange for the Hoover Building. GSA has developed criteria for determining when to solicit market interest in a swap exchange, in response to recommendations in GAO's 2014 report. In addition, GSA officials told GAO that they planned to improve the swap exchange process, including the property appraisal process, outreach to stakeholders to identify potential risks associated with future projects, and to the extent possible, mitigate such risks. Nevertheless, several factors may continue to limit use of swap exchanges, including market factors, such as the availability of alternative properties and an investor's approach for valuing properties. For example, in reviewing a proposed swap exchange in Washington, D.C., GAO found in a 2016 report that the proposals from two firms valued the two federal buildings involved in the proposed swap substantially less than GSA's appraised property value. In a 2014 report, GAO identified a number of alternative approaches to funding real property projects. Congress has provided some agencies with specific authorities to use alternative funding mechanisms—including the use of private sector funds or land swaps—for the acquisition, renovation, or disposal of federal real property without full, upfront funding, though GAO has previously reported that upfront funding is the best way to ensure recognition of commitments made in budgeting decisions and maintain fiscal controls. GAO has reported that projects with alternative funding mechanisms present multiple forms of risk that are shared between the agency and any partner or stakeholder. In addition, alternative budgetary structures could be established, such as changing existing or introducing new account structures to fund real property projects. GAO has made recommendations in the past to GSA on various real property issues, including to develop additional guidance for swap exchanges and to evaluate its approach to maintaining the Hoover Building.

The lapse in federal appropriations that occurred from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, created a partial government shutdown. As a result, agencies without funding furloughed many federal employees, and many federal employees excepted from furlough were working without pay during the lapse in appropriations. Furloughed federal employees may be eligible for UCFE benefits. Private-sector workers who are furloughed or laid off due to the partial government shutdown because they were employed by government contractors may be eligible for regular UC benefits. But, according to guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), excepted federal employees who are performing services (without pay) would generally be ineligible for UCFE benefits based on states' definitions of \"unemployment.\" In this climate, there has been congressional interest in assisting furloughed and excepted federal employees through the UI system. UI legislative issues currently facing the 116th Congress include the following: the effects of the FY2019 sequester order on UI programs and benefits, the role of UI in providing temporary income replacement during a government shutdown, state fiscal concerns related to financing UC benefits, reemployment services and eligibility assessments (RESEA), potential consideration of the UI proposals included in the President's FY2020 budget, and congressional oversight related to a proposed UC drug testing rule reissued by DOL after previously being disapproved using the Congressional Review Act. In the 116th Congress, policymakers have introduced legislation related to UCFE benefits in response to the recent partial government shutdown (S. 165, H.R. 720, H.R. 725, and H.R. 1117), legislation to provide self-employment and relocation assistance benefits (S. 136 and H.R. 556), legislation to require that states consider an individual who quit employment because of sexual harassment, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking to be eligible for UC benefits (H.R. 1585), and legislation to amend Title III of the Social Security Act to extend RESEA to all UC claimants (H.R. 1759).

Cluster munitions are valued militarily for their ability to kill or destroy multiple targets with fewer weapons systems. However, they have been criticized for their indiscriminate nature and high failure rate, resulting in large numbers of unexploded submunitions that pose a hazard for decades. The report highlights the use of cluster munitions in various conflicts, including in Laos, where an estimated 9 million to 27 million unexploded submunitions remain, causing over 10,000 civilian casualties. The report also mentions the introduction of sensor-fuzed submunitions to improve accuracy and reduce the number of unexploded submunitions. The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) was established in 1980 to restrict or ban specific types of weapons used in armed conflicts, and negotiations to address the humanitarian impact of cluster munitions began in 2007. The United States, Russia, China, Israel, Egypt, India, and Pakistan did not participate in the negotiations that led to the CCM ban in 2008. The report also mentions the Consolidated Appropriations Acts of 2010 and 2019, which prohibit the use of cluster munitions unless they meet certain standards and will only be used against clearly defined military targets.

Cluster munitions have been highly criticized internationally for causing a significant number of civilian deaths, and efforts have been undertaken to ban and regulate their use. The Department of Defense (DOD) continues to view cluster munitions as a military necessity but in 2008 instituted a policy to reduce the failure rate of cluster munitions to 1% or less after 2018. In November 2017, a new DOD policy was issued that essentially reversed the 2008 policy. Under the new policy, combatant commanders can use cluster munitions that do not meet the 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard in extreme situations to meet immediate warfighting demands. In addition, the new policy does not establish a deadline to replace cluster munitions exceeding the 1% rate and states that DOD \"will retain cluster munitions currently in active inventories until the capabilities they provide are replaced with enhanced and more reliable munitions.\" Potential issues for Congress include cluster munitions in an era of precision weapons, other weapons in lieu of cluster munitions, and the potential impact of DOD's 2017 revised cluster munitions policy."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3162, "token_length": 5394, "chunk_ppl": [14.96972942352295, 10.735183715820312, 3.76192307472229, 3.3116252422332764, 4.906712055206299, 6.454309940338135, 7.143864631652832, 6.639920711517334, 7.538137912750244, 5.251193523406982, 5.68754243850708, 6.228719234466553, 4.8281683921813965, 4.188438415527344, 2.7230193614959717, 8.297807693481445, 8.62410831451416, 7.581198215484619, 5.137379169464111, 6.655784606933594, 6.773720741271973, 10.010842323303223, 4.1680989265441895, 8.213263511657715, 5.668553352355957, 4.910539150238037, 3.5614659786224365, 12.719735145568848, 7.98703670501709, 4.627107620239258, 4.635743141174316, 5.740201473236084, 8.026835441589355, 11.308274269104004, 11.152229309082031, 7.870296955108643, 5.035152912139893, 2.3785042762756348, 60.02950668334961], "total_ppl": 6.234981060028076, "block_sizes": [25, 11, 9, 24, 13, 9, 13, 8, 17, 19, 14, 29, 28, 19, 32, 12, 32, 32, 14, 10, 11, 32, 8, 11, 30, 8, 20, 13, 10, 27, 11, 10, 11, 10, 24, 15, 24, 12, 16, 10, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 13, 32, 10, 14, 23, 10, 14, 12, 8, 8, 12, 13, 16, 18, 10, 9, 8, 14, 27, 8, 10, 8, 14, 18, 13, 27, 22, 14, 13, 8, 9, 8, 9, 12, 25, 9, 9, 13, 11, 13, 10, 9, 12, 16, 9, 9, 14, 8, 11, 13, 18, 9, 8, 30, 10, 13, 32, 11, 16, 32, 21, 9, 17, 12, 19, 9, 20, 8, 16, 14, 32, 17, 28, 9, 10, 25, 12, 8, 8, 17, 9, 11, 13, 14, 14, 11, 8, 12, 12, 14, 14, 9, 10, 12, 12, 8, 15, 8, 8, 9, 11, 10, 20, 9, 12, 8, 9, 12, 15, 8, 13, 18, 26, 13, 22, 12, 13, 10, 15, 11, 8, 9, 8, 19, 9, 11, 32, 11, 8, 25, 8, 9, 9, 14, 12, 10, 18, 8, 9, 11, 12, 11, 9, 15, 8, 9, 12, 10, 20, 13, 10, 32, 13, 13, 11, 11, 16, 9, 9, 23, 10, 15, 11, 10, 9, 21, 16, 20, 9, 10, 19, 12, 11, 13, 16, 15, 14, 32, 8, 9, 16, 8, 12, 30, 9, 12, 10, 8, 16, 9, 32, 12, 10, 13, 12, 8, 12, 9, 8, 13, 14, 15, 9, 10, 9, 9, 14, 11, 8, 8, 19, 21, 15, 9, 19, 21, 11, 17, 11, 9, 8, 15, 32, 9, 10, 8, 28, 12, 10, 9, 15, 19, 8, 12, 13, 9, 9, 8, 10, 22, 17, 8, 8, 18, 8, 8, 10, 8, 13, 8, 15, 11, 20, 11, 8, 8, 18], "mean_block_size": 13.748344370860927, "generation_time": 463.1652138233185}

{"id": 63, "pred": "In March 2015, Saudi Arabia formed a coalition to intervene in Yemen against the Ansar Allah/Houthi movement and loyalists of the former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. The United States provided logistical and intelligence support without taking direct military action. The Obama Administration supported UN Security Council Resolution 2216, which imposed an arms embargo on the Houthi-Saleh forces and demanded their withdrawal from seized areas. Since then, Congress has debated various proposals to reduce civilian casualties, improve humanitarian conditions, combat Iranian support for the Houthis, preserve maritime security, and support continued coalition efforts against Al Qaeda and Islamic State in Yemen. The conflict has been viewed through the lens of regional tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, as well as concerns over the U.S.-Saudi relationship and human rights violations. Despite opposition, no significant legislation limiting U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia was enacted during the 114th Congress. The Trump Administration has signaled strong support for the coalition, initiating a review of U.S. policy and proceeding with proposed sales of precision guided munitions, which faced opposition in Congress. The war in Yemen, now in its fourth year, has resulted in a humanitarian crisis and international criticism. The 116th Congress may continue debating U.S. support for the coalition and addressing the root causes of Yemen's instability.", "answers": ["This product provides an overview of the role Congress has played in shaping U.S. policy toward the conflict in Yemen. Summary tables provide information on legislative proposals considered in the 115th and 116th Congresses. Various legislative proposals have reflected a range of congressional perspectives and priorities, including with regard to the authorization of the activities of the U.S. Armed Forces related to the conflict; the extent of U.S. logistical, material, advisory, and intelligence support for the coalition led by Saudi Arabia; the approval, disapproval, or conditioning of U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia; the appropriation of funds for U.S. operations in support of the Saudi-led coalition; the conduct of the Saudi-led coalition's air campaign and its adherence to international humanitarian law and the laws of armed conflict; the demand for greater humanitarian access to Yemen; the call for a wider government assessment of U.S. policy toward Yemen and U.S. support to parties to the conflict; the nature and extent of U.S.-Saudi counterterrorism and border security cooperation; and the role of Iran in supplying missile technology and other weapons to the forces of the Houthi movement. The 116th Congress may continue to debate U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition and Saudi Arabia's conduct of the war in Yemen, where fighting has continued since March 2015. The war has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that began in 2011; presently, the World Food Program reports that 20 million Yemenis face hunger in the absence of sustained food assistance. The difficulty of accessing certain areas of Yemen has made it hard for governments and aid agencies to count the war's casualties. Data collected by the U.S. and European-funded Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) suggest that 60,000 Yemenis have been killed since January 2016. The Trump Administration has opposed various congressional proposals, including initiatives to reject or condition proposed U.S. arms sales or to require an end to U.S. military support to Saudi-led coalition operations in Yemen. Many in Congress have condemned the October 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi government personnel, and in general, the incident appears to have exacerbated existing congressional concerns about Saudi leaders and the pace, scope, and direction of change in the kingdom's policies.
